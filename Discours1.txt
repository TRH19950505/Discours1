Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government, Ladies and Gentlemen Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen Ambassadors, I would like to thank President Chohed Ben for hosting this conference and its organization. I will try not to repeat what has already been said, although this is always a challenge, especially in opening speeches. However, I will highlight some important action points regarding our current context and the measures needed in the months and years to come. The absolute priority for the most advanced countries is to move away from fossil fuels. We have the Paris agreement as a road map, and France is fully committed to respecting this trajectory. This will require increasing our efforts 2.5 times by 2030, although we have already doubled our efforts over the past five years. France has a concrete, funded and detailed plan to move away from fossil fuels, reduce its emissions, and contribute to a Europe committed to oil-free vehicles by 2035. At the same time, significant progress has been made in the sectors housing, air, maritime, and renewable energies. In 2030, fossil fuels will become a minority in the French energy mix, and we aim to definitively turn the page on oil by 2045 and gas by 2050. The highest emitting countries must also adopt ecological planning and transparency. increased, and the G7 as well as China have a major responsibility in this regard. Private players must also become more involved, as evidenced by the launch of the One Planet Data Hub, making it possible to compare the decarbonization trajectory of 400 large global companies. Emerging countries must absolutely move away from coal, which represents a crucial issue for the climate. While efforts have been initiated with partnerships such as JETP, it is essential to stop subsidizing new coal plants and reform financing systems to encourage renewable energy. The private investment system must be reoriented, with clear financial incentives for green projects. Furthermore, it is essential to put trade policy at the service of the ecological transition, by integrating climate clauses into WTO rules and by promoting trade in environmental goods. No one should be forced to choose between the fight against poverty and the fight for the climate, as demonstrated by the Paris Pact for People and the Planet, which mobilizes public and private financing on a large scale. A profound transformation of the international financial architecture is necessary to make it more fair and inclusive. Finally, the adaptation of agricultural models, particularly in Africa, remains a key issue, with projects such as the Great Green Wall and increased investments in the International Fund for Agricultural Development. We also need to reform the climate insurance system to meet the specific needs of middle-income and poor countries, with tailored country partnerships like the one planned with Bangladesh.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government, Mr. Executive Secretary of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, dear friends, It is first of all with pleasure that I will meet you again today. I would like to thank and congratulate the President for his welcome during this COP, which is at the same time an African COP, a climate justice COP and an implementation COP. What was highlighted before me by several speakers clearly reflects the importance of the essential work to be undertaken. We were together a year ago in Glasgow, where we raised our collective ambitions. Although significant progress has been made, we have also made many important steps. Everything that was decided in Glasgow remains and must remain valid. Even if our world has changed, the climate cannot be the adjustment variable for the war unleashed by Russia on Ukrainian soil. Indeed, Russia's aggression against Ukraine not only brought war back to Europe, but also plunged the entire world into a serious period of uncertainty. This war is generating energy and food tensions, adding additional difficulties, in particular for many countries in Africa and the Mediterranean region. These crises, occurring after the pandemic and adding to other challenges, could encourage some to relegate the climate issue to the background. However, the effects of climate change, visible in many of our countries, confirm that the climate emergency is indeed present. It is not for tomorrow: it is for today. We therefore have an obligation: to continue acting on all fronts – mitigation, adaptation, crisis preparedness and repairing the damage caused. We must live through this period of shock and uncertainty while respecting our climate commitments. I want to emphasize that we will not sacrifice our climate commitments under the energy threat from Russia. All commitments made by countries must be maintained. The richest countries, particularly in Europe, must continue to respect their national strategies, such as the European "Fit for 55" plan, which aims to reduce our emissions by 55% by 2030. This is based on increased energy sobriety, the accelerated development of renewable energies and the expansion of nuclear power. Furthermore, we must continue our efforts to gradually transition our economies away from coal, while helping emerging countries to make this transition as quickly as possible. The JETP (Just Energy Transition Partnerships), initiated in Glasgow, is a key step. France, for example, will invest one billion euros to support South Africa in a strategy combining renewable energies, nuclear power and energy savings. We want to expand this model to Indonesia, India and Senegal, and we believe that this energy revolution is not only possible but essential. We must also lead a joint fight for biodiversity, which is inseparable from the fight against climate change. Nature is our best ally in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Biodiversity and climate are two sides of the same coin. Critical ecosystems such as old-growth forests, peatlands, mangroves and wetlands must be preserved, as their destruction would release colossal carbon stores. More than 100 countries have already committed to protecting 30% of their lands and seas. We must recognize these ecosystems as having a special status and offer the States that shelter them political and financial contracts to preserve them. Initiatives have already been launched with countries such as Colombia, Gabon, Rwanda and the Philippines, and we will continue to develop these efforts in frameworks such as the "One Forest Summit". Furthermore, we must also step up our efforts to protect the oceans, a new frontier of cooperation and multilateralism. France firmly supports the ban on all exploitation of the deep seabed and will continue to take this position in international forums. Finally, climate justice is essential. We must honor our financial commitments to the countries of the South. The $100 billion promised in Copenhagen must be achieved and disbursed quickly. To date, only 82 billion have been mobilized. France invests 6 billion euros each year in this transition, including 2 billion for adaptation, and we will continue to pressure so that all rich countries respect their commitments. It is also crucial to build concrete partnerships to support the most affected regions. The Great Green Wall in Africa is a promising example, combining the fight against desertification, local economic development and preservation of biodiversity. In conclusion, we need a major shock in terms of concessional financing. We must go beyond $100 billion and take bold action, particularly on the loss and damage caused by climate change. This involves building solid, sustainable and accessible financial mechanisms to strengthen solidarity and avoid a divide between North and South.
"Mr. Emmanuel Macron, President of France,
Excellency, you have the floor.
Mr President, thank you very much. Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear friends, Many things have been said, and we had, at the opening of the session, extremely strong words and, I believe, a lot of emotion for say the emergency. We are all aware of what we are experiencing. If we are expected collectively today, it is to find what allowed, six years ago, everyone to move forward and build an agreement that was not built at the start of the COP, allowing agreements of Paris: three essential values, ambition, solidarity and trust. During these six years, some have sometimes forgotten these values. Some wanted to leave or have doubts, but we held on. When I look back over the years, we have managed to keep the entire international community united to continue to fight and cope. Now, our challenge for this COP to be a success is the meeting of intermediate results. We know that our objective is 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. This was reaffirmed yesterday at the G20 in Rome. But today, we are not there. The September report from the United Nations tells us that our current trajectories take us to 2.7 degrees. Efforts announced in advance of the COP in recent weeks are beginning to narrow this gap. In the days to come, before the close of this COP, there must be sufficient commitments to return to 1.5 degrees or to national strategies giving credibility to this objective, in particular by accelerating our efforts by 2030.
The first value that we must find is therefore ambition. This means that our national strategies must correspond to the 1.5 degree variation. As such, France, the European Union and the United Kingdom are meeting these commitments. But we must now implement our plans, and this will not be easy or unimportant.
Our challenge is the implementation of the Green Deal at European level. The figures announced show that we can give credibility to this objective, but this implies an energy transition and a transition of our economic models, which must be fair, socially supported and creating new opportunities. This transition is essential for building new sectors, developing profound innovations and creating jobs. However, the key for this COP is for the largest emitters whose national strategies are not in line with the 1.5 degree target to raise their ambition. This is the only way to make this objective credible by 2030. The second value is solidarity. We have all experienced it during the pandemic. Climate disruption is an injustice, because it is the poorest countries in Africa, the Pacific or the Caribbean that first suffer the consequences of this crisis, even though they are not responsible for it. To face it, we must honor the commitment of $100 billion per year from 2020 to 2025. Today, France and the European Union are respecting their fair share. France mobilizes more than 7 billion dollars per year, a third of which is dedicated to adaptation. But all developed economies must contribute their fair share. Leadership requires exemplary behavior. We must also mobilize, with the International Monetary Fund, additional resources, such as special drawing rights for poor and middle-income countries. Solidarity makes action possible in regions where solutions to reduce emissions exist. The agreement reached to help South Africa reduce its dependence on coal is a model to follow for a just, equitable and ambitious transition. The third value is trust and transparency. Our youth want to see commitments followed by measurable actions. In this regard, the OECD is launching an International Climate Action Program (IPAC) at this COP, which will make it possible to monitor progress country by country. I would like the OECD to establish a transparent annual report on the use of the 100 billion dollars and their allocation, because these funds must go to the countries that need them most, such as those in Africa, the Pacific, America Latin and Caribbean. Finally, we must be consistent. Our agendas against climate change must be aligned with those of biodiversity and trade. Biodiversity is our best ally in the fight against global warming. Rainforests and oceans must be protected. Likewise, our trade agreements must reflect our climate commitments. Our value chains must meet these requirements. It is essential to develop local industrial sectors, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean and South America, to respond to our challenges while creating regional economic opportunities. These are the beliefs I wanted to share today. It is our actions, our results and their transparent monitoring that will restore confidence to our youth and allow us to act usefully for future generations. THANKS."
Ladies and Gentlemen Ministers, dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen members of the diplomatic corps, ladies and gentlemen, over the past year, the scientific evidence of the climate emergency has been accumulating and is irrefutable. Our fellow citizens, and especially our youth, are its spokespersons. After the time for words, they demand actions. The Paris Agreement constitutes a compass that must guide our action, and this is the spirit of this COP: the time to act has arrived, and every minute counts. The year ahead is decisive for the success of the ecological transition and change in our societies. This responsibility is both individual and collective, but it falls first and foremost to advanced countries, which have a duty to set an example in their ambitions and the means to achieve them. For France, the ambition is carbon neutrality by 2050, now enshrined in our law. For Europe, we are defending an increase in the 2030 objective to a 55% reduction in emissions, as part of a commitment to zero carbon by mid-century. We are giving ourselves the means to achieve this ambition by transforming our industry and our transport, massively developing renewable energies, renovating our buildings, and definitively moving away from coal. But being responsible in the face of the climate emergency also means being part of international solidarity. I refuse the posture which would consist of pointing the finger at countries which do not have the means for this transition and which, often, are already paying the price of climate change. I also refuse the hypocrisy which would consist of setting objectives knowing that they cannot be achieved due to lack of means. The ecological transition will be carried out with solidarity, within our States and between our countries, in particular towards the most vulnerable. This is why developed countries have collectively committed to providing $100 billion per year for climate action in developing countries by next year. This commitment must be kept. When France welcomed the reconstitution of the Green Fund, few believed it. However, with everyone's commitment, we managed to raise 10 billion dollars, France having doubled its contribution to 1.5 billion. It is a concrete example of solidarity and commitments kept. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no alternative planet. The climate and biodiversity are our common heritage, and to protect them, there is no longer a second to lose. In September, President Emmanuel Macron launched an appeal at the United Nations for a return of courage. I believe that this COP 25 and the coming year can show that this courage is back. Thank you.
Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government, Ladies and Gentlemen Ministers, Mr President of COP 24, Madam Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, The Paris Agreement n is not just an international treaty. It is a social contract. This social contract binds us to our populations – wherever they are. But to succeed in this transition, we cannot leave aside part of the population. This transition will be united or it will not be. And I want to clarify things here: the yellow vest movement in France expressed anger, but this anger goes far beyond the climate issue. What it tells us, however, is that we must do more and faster for the planet. What it tells us is that our fellow citizens want to live better and have meaningful jobs. This is the social project contained in the Paris Agreement. This is why, and I would like to reaffirm it here, France is fully, fully mobilized to succeed in the transition to carbon neutrality. This objective remains our course. This COP 24 must therefore be the implementation of the commitments made in Paris. Our credibility and our ability to involve citizens in the ecological transition are at stake. Our populations ask us for two things: trust and consistency. The issue is first and foremost trust. To do this, we must agree: 1. On universal rules of application, 2. On how to collectively recognize our progress, in complete transparency and according to each person's capabilities, 3. On the mobilization of funding. Trust also means respecting the Paris Agreement. It means doing everything possible to achieve your goals. Today's Talanoa dialogue has already shown that the efforts of States are real but that they are not sufficient to achieve the Paris objectives. This is why today we are encouraging countries to submit new, more ambitious national contributions for 2020. The other issue is consistency. The IPCC scenarios are known to everyone. We are not on the right emissions trajectory to survive. This is what the Secretary General of the United Nations forcefully recalled at the opening of this COP. We all recognized this diagnosis by signing the Paris Agreement. It is therefore up to us to be consistent, that is to say, to act accordingly at all levels. France is therefore acting on its territory, at the European level and at the international level: 1. On our territory: we have just adopted a national low-carbon strategy which defines, sector by sector, the trajectory which will allow us to place France in a scenario of limiting global warming to 2°C. We have also adopted measures to support the transition to clean cars, clean heating and thermal insulation for everyone. 2. At the European level: we believe that the European budget must be mobilized to support the populations hardest hit by the reconversion of fossil industries. 3. At the international level: we mobilize funding to support the transition of the poorest countries and those most vulnerable to climate change. We announced a contribution of 300 million dollars to the global environment fund, we will contribute to the Adaptation Fund with 15 million euros in 2019, to the funds for least developed countries with 20 million euros and will participate in the reconstitution of the Green Climate Fund. Finally, during the One Planet Summit, we committed to dedicating 1.5 billion euros per year by 2020 to financing adaptation measures. In total, France will increase its public funding for the climate from 3 billion euros per year in 2015 to 5 billion euros per year in 2020, an increase of 60% compared to 2014. And, at the request of the United Nations General Secretariat, President MACRON and Prime Minister HOLNESS will present collective recommendations at the UN Summit in September 2019 on the promise of 100 billion in financing per year. Beyond that, the diplomatic efforts undertaken in 2019 through the next edition of the One Planet Summit in Nairobi on March 14, then through the French presidency of the G7 which begins on January 1, will show how we can massively redirect global investments. towards low-carbon development. The success of COP24 will, I hope, give us the framework and the tools to create trust and to guarantee the coherence of our action. This is necessary to fight the climate battle. But this is only the beginning. The Paris Agreement, as I already said in the introduction, is the social contract of the 21st century. This is the condition for our living together in dignified conditions. It is also for everyone the promise of a meaningful life. The Paris Agreement, in short, is hope. We cannot let our most precious common asset deteriorate. This is the historical responsibility that our generation bears. Thank you.
Mr Prime Minister of Fiji, President of COP23; Madam Chancellor, dear Angela; Ladies and gentlemen heads of state and government; Mr Secretary General of the United Nations; Mr. President of the United Nations General Assembly; Ladies and Gentlemen. For twenty-five years, every year, since the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, the scientific community has sent us warning messages. The 15,000 scientists who wrote again a few days ago have once again reminded us of this. The threshold of the irreversible has been crossed. Climatic events are intensifying and multiplying. France experienced it in the Antilles a few weeks ago, on the island of Saint-Martin. Many of you have also experienced this in recent months or years. The balance of the planet is ready to be disrupted, as evidenced by the warming of the oceans or the disappearance of many threatened species. All of humanity is thus affected, particularly the most vulnerable populations. Because climate change adds injustice to injustice, adds poverty to poverty, adds insecurity to insecurity. It particularly affects those who are already the most fragile. In this way, the fight against climate change is one of the major battles of our time. This fight is being played out on the international scene and that is the very purpose of this conference. We have set ourselves ambitious goals. The Paris agreement signed almost two years ago is here. It is, as the Chancellor has just reminded us, a starting point, but a starting point that we hold on to, and on which we will not give up. This starting point sets a target of increasing global temperature by 1.5 degrees on average by 2100. Today we are above 3 degrees. If we continue as we are doing today, whatever the efforts already made in recent years, this means that we tacitly, collectively accept here the disappearance of a good number of the populations represented here. That by 2100 we now tacitly accept that many of the peoples represented there will disappear. We are not ready for it. So this requires a strong commitment. I want to salute the commitment of Morocco and Fiji for last year's COP and the one you are chairing today, and the commitment of all those present in this room continue to work on the international level. But we now need clear and firm commitments. On the international level, we need scientific expertise, a constantly fueled scientific debate which informs the decision. The IPCC is one of the major components of this work. But today it is threatened; threatened by the decision of the United States not to guarantee their financing. I therefore hope that Europe will replace the Americans and I want to tell you here that France will be there. I hope that as many European states as possible can work with us, together, to compensate for the loss of American funding. I can help you Europeans work alongside us, together, to compensate for the loss of American funding. I can already guarantee you that from 2018, not a cent will be missing for the IPCC to function, move forward and continue to inform our decisions. We must accelerate the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and therefore make commitments which will involve the responsibility of governments, local authorities and the private sector; This is the primary objective of the negotiations that you are conducting, Mr. President, and I hope that all countries take their responsibility not to call into question the balances decided two years ago. But beyond these decisions which imply the spirit of responsibility of each and everyone, we must also implement the decisions, we must obtain the first results. And this is the objective, the Chancellor has just reminded us, with all of you, that the Secretary General of the United Nations, the President of the World Bank wanted to carry out for next December 12 in Paris: to be able to come together and put highlight the first concrete results, the first future prospects, and above all mobilize the public and private financing which will make it possible to do so. It is therefore the foundations, the private sector, the cities, the regions and the States which will be mobilized with a concrete battle plan and with a list of the first victories of recent months, the victories in progress but also the battle plan to be implemented. come. What I hope for and what I set as a collective objective for the Summit on December 12 is to show that cities and the American private sector will be able to compensate for the entirety of the American commitment to climate action. But beyond this objective, all the regional, public and private funding that we are mobilizing will make it possible to give, in particular to the most vulnerable States, a real road map, funding to be able to innovate and be there. of the essential environmental transition. In the coming months, we will also have to implement a profound transformation of our international aid in this area, in order to help with adaptation, in order to mark our collective solidarity with the climate transition that the most vulnerable countries need. At European level we must also commit to an objective: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Chancellor has just reiterated this very clearly; and as for France with 4 priorities in this area. The first, to promote, encourage and actively participate in the financing of all the interconnections that we need. Between Germany and France but also for our country with Ireland, Spain, Italy, Benelux, Portugal. These interconnections are the guarantee of better use of renewable energies everywhere on our continent and in particular within the European Union, and it is the guarantee of accelerating the reduction of greenhouse gases and the lowest production. less compatible with this strategy. The second priority is to have a floor price for CO2 in Europe. And I am in favor of being able in the coming months to establish, as we have already outlined, a real price of 30 euros per tonne for CO2, which we know is the reference price which will allow lastingly change behavior, transform the priorities of our investors, our industrial players and in no European country will this be easy. Everywhere we will have industrialists who will try to ask for time, not to agree on such an objective; and I am aware of the challenges that this poses in each of our countries, but if we do not adopt this policy we will transform our collective behavior and Europe will never live up to what is expected of it. Alongside this, this requires essential support measures; this also requires real decisions at our borders, and in particular a border tax which will also protect our economic sectors against imports from countries which do not respect the same objectives at all and decide not to commit themselves. in this environmental transition. This floor price of CO2 is the step after the very good agreement obtained last week by the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament which Chancellor Angela MERKEL has just welcomed, the agreement on ETS which goes into common sense but which must be completed in the coming year. The third axis on which we need to move forward at European level is the integration of environmental objectives into our commercial policy. If we want to move forward credibly we must strengthen our investments, strengthen the transformation of our industrial sectors to be more compliant strengthen our investments, strengthen the transformation of our industrial sectors to be more compliant with these environmental objectives, but we also need when we negotiate trade agreements that take this environmental consideration into account, and do not negotiate agreements with countries that do not play the game or that are less ambitious than us, since this would diminish our collective ambitions. Finally, we need to work on accelerating the rise of renewable energies. And if we want them to continue to develop to truly replace so-called non-intermittent energies, we need to make progress on energy storage. This is the real disruption on the scientific and industrial level and this is why I know that with the Chancellor we are fully committed in this area. We will together promote European investments that go towards energy storage and move forward together, particularly on joint scientific industrial projects to finance breakthrough innovation in energy storage, finance industrial mergers that will allow us to move forward. in the battery and in all the technologies that will allow us to move faster in this transformation. Finally, as far as France is concerned, we must accelerate this transformation with an obsession, that of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. For this, we have committed ourselves over the last few months - and this was the firm commitment within my government of Minister of State Nicolas HULOT - we are clearly committed to an exit from the production of fossil fuels and a real transformation of our production model. Thus, France has decided to close all coal-fired power plants by the end of 2021, the absence of any construction of new thermal power plants, and above all through a hydrocarbon bill voted in the National Assembly and which will be completed in the coming weeks, the ban on any new permits for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in our country. This is the first time that a developed country has decided on such a policy for its own territory; we assume it because it is essential to meet the climate and the transition that we have made. This transformation also involves accelerating the rise of renewable energies. And therefore to do this, to be able to accelerate the technological changes that I have just mentioned and this European partnership. And let no one be wrong here, claiming that we should accelerate the closures of nuclear power plants without having previously responded to this is to condemn us in the coming years to reopening coal-fired power plants or thermal power plants. And therefore do the opposite of what we are committed to doing. The priority is to reduce emissions, the priority is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and therefore the CO2 policy is the one in which the government is fully committed and will have results in the next few years. This priority is also that of the climate plan which decided for mobility, on the one hand to initiate an unprecedented tax policy allowing all modes of transport to converge for better results in terms of carbon emissions and particle emissions, and this is the objective that we have set for ourselves within twenty years to eliminate vehicles contributing to the greenhouse effect. Firm commitment from the State, from all the industrialists in which we have therefore decided to enter. And it is also the same commitment that leads us to invest massively in the thermal renovation of buildings, in energy efficiency and in a real investment policy in the transformation of our industrial and economic energy model. The climate plan that was presented by the minister is a courageous plan. No retreat on our commitment to the climate has been made, on the contrary; responsible decisions were taken which abandoned unrealistic fetishes but above all took an agenda of credible, proactive decisions which will require the commitment of all. I will see to it and I stand here as guarantor. Rich countries, ladies and gentlemen, have a double responsibility. We have participated in climate change, we have participated in the transformation of the industrial and contemporary era with all the effects that we know; we must therefore actively participate today in the climate transition and the mitigation of its effects. In the last century, rich countries imposed their industrial model on the world, today they are forbidden from imposing their own tragedy on the world. We therefore have only one obsession: action; we only have one horizon: it is now. Thank you.
"Your Majesty, Mr. Secretary General of the United Nations, Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government, Mr. President of COP22, Madam Executive Secretary, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would first like to thank His Majesty, the King of Morocco, MOHAMMED VI, for organizing this Conference.
Barely a year ago, COP 21 was held in Paris. I wanted it to be organized in France. I was aware of the difficulties that awaited us. I remembered a number of failures, but I knew how high the hopes were.
However, this December 12, 2015, in an exceptional context, appalling even, since terrorist attacks had taken place in Paris, many heads of state and government came, worked and concluded a historic agreement.
I still remember this moment when Laurent FABIUS, president of the COP, sealed the Paris Agreement. We are gathered here in Marrakech, one year later.
The Agreement was historic and what we must say here is that this Agreement is irreversible.
It is irreversible in law. It came into force on November 4. More than 100 states, representing two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions, have ratified it.
I salute the action taken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, and by Ségolène ROYAL, the President of the COP, for achieving this result in record time and an agreement of this magnitude on an international scale.
The Agreement is also irreversible in fact, because governments, those you represent, businesses, non-governmental organizations, citizens of the world are taking initiatives, launching projects, inventing concrete solutions to combine the fight against global warming and development.
We are inevitably moving towards a model that will be much lower in carbon. Renewable energies already represent 90% of new electricity production.
More than 70 countries and thousands of companies have joined a coalition that has set itself the goal of doubling the share of global emissions covered by a carbon price in 2030. Even finance is involved in this process, 80 billion euros have been raised in terms of green bonds and France itself will set an example by making the first sovereign issue of a country, from the start of the year, for investments in the ecological transition and energy. This is why the Agreement is irreversible in law and in fact.
In addition, it is irreversible in consciousness. The climate emergency did not stop on December 12 in Paris. These last few months have been the hottest in modern history and the link has been established between man-made warming, human beings, and disasters. Everyone is no longer unaware that if we do nothing, rising ocean levels will submerge islands and also coasts, including the most populated on our planet. Inaction would be disastrous for the world, cause despair for future generations and be dangerous for peace.
Millions of people would be displaced, conflicts - we already know them - linked to access to water, to resources, then in Africa, famine linked to drought, which could concern millions of people, which would not not disappear, would be forced to migrate, hoping to find resources elsewhere that had become insufficient to feed them.
So acting for the climate means ensuring the security and stability of the world. I came here to Marrakech, not to recall Paris, but to call for consistency and perseverance. The Paris Agreement is the work of everyone. It belongs to everyone, it depends on everyone, it is in everyone's interest.
Barack OBAMA's role was crucial in obtaining an agreement in Paris. Particularly in the context of decisions that had been taken with China and other countries. The United States, the world's leading economic power and second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, must respect the commitments that have been made. It is not simply their duty, it is their interest, that of the American population who are hit by climate change, because no country is immune. This is also the interest of American companies which have invested in the ecological transition. It is also the will of the cities and the federated states which have mobilized to support us in the Climate Agreement.
France I assure you here will lead this dialogue with the United States and its new president, with openness, with respect, but with rigor and determination and in the name of the 100 States which have already ratified the Agreement from Paris.
I also want to appeal to perseverance. We are all united around the objective of limiting the rise in temperatures to below 2 degrees and, if possible, 1.5 degrees. But I assure you, we must speed up. Accelerate so that we can implement the Paris Agreement faster than expected, even before 2018. Accelerate the implementation of our national contributions. Here again, France wants to set an example and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. In the same way, these same emissions will be divided by 4 by 2050. Accelerate, always accelerate. We are also going to close coal-fired power plants by 2023, because we are aware that it takes time, that we need transition, but that we must also have this objective.
We want to put a price on carbon; 22 euros in 2016, more in 2030. But we must have this desire for carbon neutrality by 2050. I know that not all countries are ready for it. But France has decided to take the lead in this “carbon neutrality coalition” by 2050.
COP22, here in Marrakech, must be about solutions. It must place the future of Africa at the forefront of priorities. The world owes an ecological debt to the African continent. Of the 50 countries most affected by global warming, 36 are located in sub-Saharan Africa.
This is why I wanted a 2020 agenda for Africa to be implemented; the objective is to allow all Africans to have access to electricity. An initiative for renewable energies in Africa was launched in Paris during COP21. Ten billion euros were promised; France will provide two over the next five years. But I know that this commitment will be exceeded.
We now have a roadmap. The African Development Bank implemented the procedures; 240 projects were identified by the president of COP21. We will make sure to mobilize the European Union, because the destinies of Africa and Europe are linked.
Finally, what convinced many of those who were hesitant to sign the Paris Agreement was knowing whether the most developed countries were going to make commitments and, above all, keep them. The 100 billion dollars by 2020 will be there. We must do everything to mobilize them. France, here again, will keep its word; our annual funding for climate will be 5 billion per year by 2020, including 1 billion for adaptation.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know what this meeting can mean for many. The idea that the essentials would have been done in Paris and that there would only be implementation to accomplish: nothing could be further from the truth. Now is where it all begins. Especially in the world we know. A world crossed by terrible trials. A world full of uncertainties, with conflicts, with threats, with terrorism, with suffering civilian populations, also with poverty and considerable inequalities.
This is why, for those who trade in fear, there is a land that has become a breeding ground to prosper. There may be, at some point, doubt about what capacity the international community may have. There may be questions about this globalization which must be controlled. I know everything that can, at any given moment, haunt our people.
But there are also factors of hope and the Paris Agreement is one of them. It is proof that the international community can overcome its divisions, can act, can preserve what is most essential to us.
So, Majesty, Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government, Mr. Secretary General, Ladies and Gentlemen Delegates, we are not betraying a promise of hope. We make it happen. We carry it. Here in Marrakech, we are the guardians of the letter and spirit of the Paris Agreement. We will bring it to life, because what unites us, beyond our differences, beyond our convictions, our religions, our situations, our modes of development, what unites us, is what we have in common and that is simply our planet. THANKS"
"And you just had a magnificent sentence that I would like to repeat, because you said that 70% of the citizens of the Philippines depend on agriculture and the sea. You also said this strong sentence: "Their social security, it's nature." water and air These elements constitute major challenges, and the Philippines, which has suffered so cruelly from climate disasters, represents an eloquent example. It is an example that inspires us to move forward, to give hope and hope during this COP 21. It is in this spirit. that we will sign a partnership agreement associating the Philippines, France, Conservation International, the French Development Agency (AFD) and the French Global Environment Facility. The program that this partnership will implement aims to demonstrate the potential. natural systems to resist the effects of climate change. This is precisely the purpose of this high-level panel: to explore the connection between so-called “gray” infrastructures and “green” infrastructures to better protect coastal territories. This program combines the construction of civil engineering works, such as dykes and groynes, with the strengthening of solutions based on ecosystems. The projects will be implemented on several pilot sites in the municipality of Concepcion, particularly damaged by the passage of the typhoon, and whose population is very aware of the need to act. Several mangrove rehabilitation actions have already been undertaken, and this innovative program will provide concrete responses to this area while carrying out a large-scale demonstration. This demonstration could then be extended to other coastal territories, particularly island territories, and at all scales – local, regional, national and international. The project management of this partnership will be carried out jointly by Conservation International, which has extensive experience in this field, in collaboration with the Philippine Ministry of the Environment. This project also aims to contribute to the economic and social development of local communities so that they take full ownership of it. We know that integrated projects, co-built with citizens and taking into account local aspirations, are both the most effective and the most sustainable. The program will therefore concern the municipality of Concepcion and neighboring villages, including the diversification of livelihoods. The marine ecosystems of the Philippines, true reservoirs of biodiversity of global importance, will be at the heart of these initiatives. France is very pleased to engage the AFD and the French Global Environment Fund, instruments of French bilateral cooperation, to contribute 1.5 million euros out of a total budget of 4.5 million euros. euros over four years. This program will not only be useful for the territories directly concerned, but also to serve as a laboratory for other vulnerable territories around the world.
France is already carrying out similar actions in its overseas territories. For example, a plan to reclaim 50,000 hectares of mangroves was launched in Guadeloupe, coupled with the reconstitution of coral reefs, severely impacted by climate change. These initiatives show that we must consider the entire chain of life, because the impacts on marine ecosystems also affect biodiversity, particularly that of fish. These actions must be extended and integrated into a global reflection on the protection of ecosystems.
To conclude, the subject that brings us together today – how nature can provide solutions to climate change – is both new and brings job creation, particularly in sectors linked to biomimicry and the reconstruction of phenomena. natural. While there is a lot of talk about renewable energy and energy efficiency, there is also immense potential in the development of companies specializing in ecosystem restoration. This field of innovation requires experimental laboratories to demonstrate that the fight against climate change is not only based on massive infrastructure such as dikes, but also on natural solutions. Mangroves, beaches and coral reefs offer sustainable solutions, while sea walls, although necessary in the short term, show their limits in the face of increasing climate risks. 
It is essential to combine heavy engineering and solutions inspired by nature, often neglected but nevertheless essential. These solutions must be adapted to the new challenges imposed by climate change, in order to build a resilient and harmonious future with our environment."
Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations, dear Ban Ki-moon, Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government, Madam Executive Secretary of our Conference, Ladies and Gentlemen Ministers, today is a historic day. France welcomes 150 heads of state and government as well as thousands of participants from all continents. Never has a conference brought together so many authorities from so many countries, and never, I mean never, has the stakes of an international meeting been so high. This is about the future of our planet, the future of life. And yet, two weeks ago, right here in Paris, it was death that a group of fanatics sowed in our streets. I would like to express the gratitude of the French people for all the signs of support, all the messages and all the signs of friendship received since the tragic events of November 13. These tragedies distress us, but they also compel us. They force us to focus on the essentials. Your presence here raises immense hope that we have no right to disappoint. Billions of human beings are looking at us. The fight against terrorism and the fight against global warming are two global challenges that we must take up. We must offer our children more than a world free of terror: a planet protected from disaster, a viable planet. The past year has been one of all records: records for temperature, CO₂ concentration, extreme weather events, droughts, floods, cyclones, melting ice, rising sea levels and ocean acidification. The victims number in the millions, the material damage in the billions. No country or region is spared from the effects of climate change. And how can we accept that it is the poorest countries, those which emit the least greenhouse gases, which are the most affected? It is in the name of climate justice that I speak to you. We must act to avoid conflict, mass migration and shortages of essential resources like water. Despite everything, hope has arisen with the preparation of COP21. Last September, the international community adopted the Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations General Assembly, thanks to the remarkable work of the Secretary-General. Today, 190 countries have developed action plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. Local authorities, businesses, investors and citizens around the world have also mobilized for the climate. The dazzling progress made in clean and renewable energies opens up the prospect of a non-carbon economy. To make this conference a success, France has mobilized all its forces and its entire government, starting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laurent Fabius, who will chair this conference. I myself have visited regions affected by climate change, and I am convinced that we must ensure sustainable and equitable development without compromising our planet's limited resources. For this, three conditions are necessary: ​​define a credible trajectory to contain warming below 2°C, or even 1.5°C; guarantee a united response to the climate challenge, with differentiation mechanisms and sufficient funding; and mobilize the whole of global society. We must also transform our economies by integrating clear signals, such as the introduction of a carbon price, in order to change investment choices and make the necessary technologies accessible to all. Paris must mark the start of a profound change. We must think of the planet as a single space, establish a pact of equity between the North and the South, and establish a partnership between man and nature. This exceptional meeting in Paris is not an opportunity that we can miss. We are deciding here the very future of our planet. The greatest danger is not to aim too high and miss our goal, but to aim too low and reach it. So, let's raise our ambition to the highest level to honor this hope and protect our planet. THANKS.
"Mr. President, Dear Manuel,
First of all I would like to congratulate you on this great success. I think it's obviously due to everyone who is there, but you have shown what an effective president can do and you have set the bar very high. I will modestly try to get closer.
I wanted to intervene for a few moments. First to simply say that we are going to prepare things to welcome you all in the best possible way.
I noted in all the interventions that the delegates emphasized that they wanted great success in Paris. I'm going to tell you a secret: me too! If we hadn't come to the decision we did tonight, things would have been a lot more difficult. But there is already, as we all know, a lot of work to be done between now and December next year to resolve the issues that are still outstanding.
Manuel Pulgar-Vidal gave us the path to a good presidency, for which ambition, listening and a spirit of compromise are needed. These are the three watchwords that France will follow.
It is a considerable responsibility and honor to host a COP, especially when we repeat that the main decisions which will affect the future must be taken in Paris. We appreciate this responsibility and this honor and we will try to be worthy of it.
I would like to add a point that strikes me: when we talk about the work we do here, we hear things from outside that are sometimes unfair, as if we were happily multiplying complicated discussions that drag on forever. But, everyone who is there has dedicated part of their lives and even their whole lives to the issue of climate to ensure that millions of people around the world can live better. I think this message, which is the true meaning of the work we do here, must go outside.
A final word. We all remember what happened in Copenhagen. I think that thanks to the work of all of you and the decision taken this evening, the ghost of Copenhagen is fading away and the hope of success in Paris is getting closer. We owe this to all of you and France will do its utmost to welcome you as appropriate. THANKS."
"Mr. Minister, dear Gabriel
Ladies Gentlemen,
I am delighted to open your side event on climate change observatories in tropical areas.
Firstly, because for the Minister of Development that I am, in charge, with Laurent Fabius and Ségolène Royal, of the preparation of COP21, the question of the impacts of climate change is at the heart of my concerns. The threat that climate change poses to water, agriculture and health shows that climate is a development issue.
Development can no longer be thought of as before, with the fight against poverty on one side and the preservation of the planet on the other. Today we can no longer think about an electrification policy without wondering if it will aggravate the climate problem, with coal for example, or if on the contrary it will contribute to controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
Likewise, development policy can no longer ignore the impacts of future climate change. Repeated typhoons in the Philippines, droughts in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, melting glaciers in Peru, the impacts are there. I was also able to see this in Samoa, where the rise in sea levels, combined with hurricanes, threatens all populations living on the coasts.
And at the same time, we are often helpless in the face of the impacts of climate change, because in practical terms, we do not know what to expect. And is even more true in tropical regions.
These are extremely sensitive to the impacts linked to climate change. France knows this and is experimenting with it in many of its overseas territories, for which the lack of reliable data is a problem for politicians, who want to adapt but do not know how to do so, due to lack of data.
An adequate observation, an observation which makes it possible to gather specific and precise elements on the evolution of the climate on a regional scale and on its socio-environmental impact, is essential to construct a concrete and operational response for adaptation in the most vulnerable countries.
This observation is essential to make the right decisions. For example, France wanted to integrate climate resilience into all its infrastructure projects in Africa. We can only do this if we have data on the impacts. Generalizing this data, and sharing access to this information with the most vulnerable countries, is a major challenge for Paris Climate 2015, of which adaptation will be a pillar.
In this sense, I want to salute the work of the IRD and its partners. The IRD, present in Peru since 1967, is one of the only institutes to have observatories in these tropical areas, where it works in close collaboration with its Latin American and African partners. A beautiful book was presented yesterday on this subject, a great example of collaborative work. I also believe more generally that we must bring the world of research and that of development closer together. We will be more effective by innovating together!
I am here to tell you that your work is essential. As you know, we want to make Paris a conference for solutions to climate change. You have in your hands the first stones of a solution. I can only say “Bravo”, but also encourage you to continue and amplify, and see you in Paris to place your contribution on the solutions agenda.”
"Mr. President,
France attaches great attention, great value, to the work carried out by the Durban platform. And I congratulate the presidency of the COP for having organized this ministerial dialogue, which is useful for our exchanges.
I want to commend the work of the co-chairs of the Durban Platform who produced draft conclusions which all parties considered to be a useful starting point but which could still be improved. This text is an important first step in developing a road map towards Lima and then Paris, where we wish, like many of those who spoke this morning, the adoption of a universal, quantified, binding and just !
The Warsaw text must, in our opinion, meet three strong expectations:
- First, it must formally launch the process and the stages of preparing everyone for commitments which must be known sufficiently in advance of the Paris meeting in 2015.
- Then, he must give the orientations of the ADP work program, from next March, to prepare the future Paris agreement.
- Finally, it must decide to launch a process intended to raise our common ambition, before 2020. Work in this direction must begin without delay and be discussed at a high level from 2014.
Several delegates indicated this morning that 2014 must be a year of ambition. From this point of view, I welcome the initiative of the Secretary General of the United Nations in favor of the mobilization of all, and at the highest level. But the year 2014 begins on January 1 and I am not one of those who think, as I heard today from several delegates, that we have "two years ahead of us to achieve an agreement in Paris. » No, we don't have two years to reach an agreement in Paris. Paris starts today! Also, we hope that, from the beginning of 2014, the work of preparing a text of the negotiations with a view to Paris can begin, in order to concretize the commitments of each party as quickly as possible, in transparency!
Opening the Warsaw conference, Christiana Figueres told us that what is being played in this stadium was not a game, that there were not two teams, developed countries on one side, developing countries on the other. other, but the entirety of humanity.
This morning, many people mentioned France, who spoke of Paris, and the considerable expectations surrounding this meeting at the end of 2015.
Well, France, which I represent this morning, will take its responsibilities as it has always known how to do in its history.
A little over 20 years ago, in Rio, at the Earth Summit, a former President of the French Republic, François Mitterrand invited the world to adopt an “obligation of mutual ecological assistance”. And he expressed the wish that “the name of Rio would be synonymous with hope!” »
More than 20 years later, I invite you to ensure that the name of Paris becomes, for the entire world, synonymous with the realization of this hope by giving birth to this mutual ecological obligation and this climate justice to which all peoples of the planet are calling us!”
"Mr. Ambassador,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends
First of all, thank you very much for taking your time to come and welcome me and my two colleagues who made this trip, Ms. Delphine Batho, who is responsible for the environment and Pascal Canfin who, alongside me, takes care of development. We have the pleasure of having French parliamentarians who are also here and whom I salute. Thank you for taking some of your time to come and welcome me and we will have the opportunity to talk when I have finished this little speech.
I am here for two reasons.
The first, as you probably know, is the very important international climate conference. It's about finding ways to fight what we call climate change and, above all, climate disruption. And which, if it develops, will have devastating consequences on the entire planet. The Qataris, who are very welcoming people, decided to host this international conference and it began a few days ago. We hope in good conditions, but conferences of this type have the particularity that it is only at the end that we will be able to know whether the results are good or not. In any case, it was extremely important that France was present at this conference because of its importance. This is why I decided to lead our delegation there. This is all the more important since, as you may know, the President of the Republic has proposed that in 2015 - that is to say in a short time - it will be France which welcomes the equivalent of this conference but at a time when even more important decisions will have to be made.
Our availability to host this conference is to the extent that we are the only candidate. Is it a risk or is it an opportunity? In any case, it is a historic opportunity that we wanted to seize because the climate issue is so important that it was necessary for France and Europe to do their utmost to try to move forward.
This will certainly be very difficult because, whether we are a specialist or not, we understand to what extent, on the one hand, climate change can have extremely serious consequences and, on the other hand, how much we must change habits in economic, social and financial matters to cope with these disruptions. The experts, who unfortunately in this area are not wrong, tell us that the upper barrier should be set at 2°C maximum, but that it is perhaps towards 4°C that we are heading. Which means that in a short time there would be the same change that we have experienced since the Ice Age. This means an upheaval with many dramatic consequences.
France wants, with many other countries, to mobilize to try to stop this disruption. This is also the meaning of our presence here with my fellow ministers. 2015 is tomorrow. We need to start preparing contacts and dialogues because I am not at all a specialist in these issues but I am going to become one. In any case, what I understood is that we can only succeed on the basis of collective action and the collective begins here.
The second reason why I am here is to underline the importance and quality of the links between Qatar and France. In addition to the speech I made at the Convention and the fact that my colleagues and I were able to dialogue with a certain number of ministers, I had the pleasure and the honor of speaking at length with the Emir, then to have lunch with the Prime Minister. On this occasion, I verified what I already knew: how close the relationship between Qatar and France is. I ventured the concept of strategic friendship, there may be for some a contradiction in terms but, for me, it is true that the friendship is old between Qatar and France. There is the strategic dimension because Qatar plays a certain role within the Arab countries and in the region and because France plays a certain role both in Europe and in the world. It is no coincidence that these two paths met.
This is the second time I've been here. The first was just before the presidential election, when François Hollande asked me to represent him internationally. So I came and I was received very kindly. It would have been shocking if, having been received so kindly, I did not reciprocate after the election. I found what I had anticipated but, this time, with better knowledge of the files and the people.
It is true that our relations are extremely close and you are not only witnesses but also actors, particularly in these economic relations that are sometimes ridiculed in France. As for Qatari investments, I can tell you - and I am sure that I am acting as your interpreter in saying this - that we are very happy to receive these investments as long as they create jobs, as they bring a movement of exchange. This is what I said this morning to the Emir and the Prime Minister. The only wish we have is that they develop in the opposite direction. I notice, while walking the avenues, that the number of French companies working here in Qatar is considerable. The fairly specific conversation that we had this morning with my interlocutors shows that there is a desire on the part of Qatar for the French presence to develop. When we know the dynamism of this country, its current resources and its potential, we can only be extremely happy since, given the situation in Europe, it is in countries with strong development that it we must come and seek our growth and in particular here.
What also struck me in the conversations I had with Qatari officials, here or in Paris, is that our relationship does not stop at the economic dimension, even if it is essential. It also goes into the educational and cultural fields and we know that Qatar has great ambitions in this area because it has become a full member of the Francophonie. I asked our Qatari friends, since they are now members of La Francophonie, to speak French. So, it is the development that I welcome here, of our establishments. If I heard correctly, a whole part of the Qatari population, at least its elites, wish to come to our establishments. Well done !
And then, there is a cultural dimension. I had the opportunity, already during my last stay, to visit the magnificent museum created by Pei and the interior designed by Jean-Michel Wilmotte. I know that new perspectives are opening up with what Jean Nouvel is doing. Finally, in the scientific field, we have a convergence of ambition. Also, friendship and strategy must work together and that does not spoil things: on the contrary, it is what controls them. In terms of international political analysis, our visions are extremely close and sometimes even identical. In recent weeks, we have not only discussed, but also acted together regarding Syria. This national coalition was built, almost by force, is the gathering of the opposition forces that we were calling for. It is no coincidence that France was the first country to recognize, in the diplomatic sense of the term, this coalition. We will also see extensions of this in the days to come.
We need, if we want to put an end to the criminal regime of Bashar Al-Assad and prepare an alternation which can be achieved without insurmountable difficulty - in short, to avoid the Iraqi counter-model -, to confront the regime - which is in the process of lose your support - to build an alternative solution; This is what we call in our jargon: the day after. The Qataris, with others in Arab countries and with us in Europe, are trying to build this alternative.
It's the same thing in relations between Israel and Gaza. When we were at the height of tension - even if it was not made public - the Qataris and the French put together a certain number of proposals. We French have made this choice, confirmed by history, to be able to speak with each other. This unique position gives us credit with the Palestinians and the Israelis. It is also no coincidence that I myself went there to speak with Prime Minister Netanyahu, with President Mahmoud Abbas, after having visited a number of Arab countries, notably of Qatar.
In short, whether it is in the economic, educational, cultural and scientific fields, whether it is international action, everyone realizes how necessary and important it is at this moment, we are traveling on the same rails. This is why the action you are taking here is so important. Of course, there is only one French ambassador, who is at my side, but you are all ambassadors in your various qualities. There are a lot of members of the business community here, education leaders, people who work here in the diplomatic service, people who are here in connection with the environmental conference, artists, engineers, architects, doctors. You, all of you, are the advanced points of what is France.
What I wanted to say to you this evening - and what I would like you to remember - is that we always have a thought for what you are doing. You do it because life has pushed you to do so, because these are your choices, but have the certainty that for our compatriots, for the President of the Republic and for the government of the country, you are our ambassadors. We are extremely proud of what you do. The only thing that falls to us in return for this pride is to give everyone the means to work well and that is what we are trying to do in the economic field.
I supported this somewhat new notion of economic diplomacy and I asked the Quai d'Orsay, which was moreover spontaneously inclined to do so, for a particular effort in the field of the economy because finally that would have It was a paradox all the same that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs deals with all crises except the economic crisis. So, from now on, in liaison with other administrations, we are really on this economic dimension. But we never forget that the economy for a country like France cannot be separated from culture, human rights, history, defense, democracy. It is all of this that makes France a unique powerhouse. When I was speaking earlier with my Qatari interlocutors to ask them why they loved France, well, even if they used other words, it was a little for that. France is not the largest country in the world but it is a country which does not act only for itself but for a universal dimension; This is what I believe I have felt throughout the world and also felt with our Qatari friends. And this is felt because you are daily bearers of this message.
Mr. Ambassador, you said thank you for being there, but it is not up to you to thank me for being there, it is up to me to thank you for being what you are and doing what you do. you are serving France.
Long live the friendship between Qatar and France,
Long live the Republic and long live France."
Madam President, Gentlemen Presidents, Gentlemen Heads of Government, Ladies and Gentlemen Ministers, Honored Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, A great South African lady, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature and anti-apartheid activist, Nadine GORDIMER, wrote that: “The formulas which seem to have lost all their meaning by having been repeated too often are those which contain the most truth”. We repeat ?? leisure that the urgency of climate change must push us to act. This phrase retains its full meaning today. Now let’s translate it into action. Having only a few minutes at this platform, I would like to go straight to the point, sincerely hoping that my remarks will facilitate the very important negotiation that is taking place here. I hear some telling us that they have red lines that must not be crossed and that they do not want to engage right now in the negotiation of a legally binding global agreement. While respecting their positions, I would like to try to convince them by simply telling them two things. The first is that the only red line that matters is the one the planet is crossing. We have received enough alerts. The World Energy Outlook 2011 from the International Energy Agency tells us that the window for action is closing. If, by 2017, we do not adopt radical measures to renew our energy infrastructure and reduce our energy consumption, then the existing equipment fleet will at best lead us to a temperature rise scenario of 3, 5°C. At worst, if we continue our inertia, the rise in temperature could even eventually reach 6°C and effectively escape all control. Let us imagine the dramatic consequences of such warming for each of our countries. We must not and cannot approach the issue of climate change like a traditional negotiation. As the President of the Maldives said during his visit to Paris in October: “We do not negotiate with Nature”. These negotiations are not a zero-sum game where there are winners and losers. If we don't act, we will all lose. If we act in a resolute and coordinated manner, we will all win. Everyone must contribute their stone to the building, however modest it may be. France did it for its part. As a member of the European Union, we have shown our commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, which is the only existing international legal instrument whose aim and effect is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. France also took action this year during the Presidency of the G20, by advancing discussions on sources of financing to fight climate change in developing countries. I hope that we will be able to put in place on these bases over the coming months the innovative financing that we need to feed the green fund and to keep our financial promises. I am thinking of the tax on financial transactions or market instruments on international transport emissions. That would be a great signal. We would thus demonstrate that globalization can draw from its very dynamics mechanisms of solidarity to make it fairer. The second thing I would like to say is that there can be no alternative to a multilateral framework for reducing emissions. This is why we must launch a process right here in Durban to reach a global agreement. There is no other way. There is no Plan B for the planet. The extension of the Kyoto Protocol, which we are ready to accept, can only be a transitional and partial solution. It is an encouragement to action, but little more. States ready to engage with the European Union for a second period only represent at best 16% of global emissions. However, the effectiveness of our efforts lies in the union of as many people as possible. The European Union will do its part in any case. It has made internal commitments with the Climate Energy package, and it will keep them. If it were alone in committing to a second Kyoto period, this would therefore not prevent any additional tonnes of carbon. Everyone will understand that to respond to the challenges, we need a much broader agreement, covering, while respecting the principles of the convention of course, all the major economies. Such an objective requires a roadmap, a timetable and content consistent with the ambitions we defined together in Cancun. Concrete partnerships such as the one we launched with Kenya, in close collaboration with Norway, for universal access to renewable energy, are extremely useful. And even essential when we know that 1.3 billion human beings are deprived of energy and therefore of development prospects. The commitments made voluntarily and on a national basis by large emerging countries are also very encouraging. But neither these partnerships nor voluntary approaches can replace the international framework that we all need to guarantee the success of our objective. I want to talk about the objective that we set ourselves together in Cancun: to contain the rise in temperature compared to the pre-industrial era to below two degrees. This perspective is unfortunately receding. We must recognize the gap that exists between our commitments and this objective. The recent report from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) quantifies this precisely. We will probably have to be more ambitious and adjust our objectives in 2013 or 2015 based on the next report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Without an international framework, we will not succeed. Let us bring our actions into line with our promises! The hours that remain for us here in Durban promise to be decisive. I know that a very large majority of delegations share the ambitions that I have just stated and the convictions that I have just expressed. I am convinced that together we can forge the agreement that the planet needs, in particular so that this beautiful South African land, “fragrant and colorful” as Nadine GORDIMER liked to describe it, remains so beyond generations.
“Madam President,
Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government, Ladies and Gentlemen Ministers, dear delegates
Ladies and gentlemen,
I - Some denounced last year the failure of Copenhagen. Others wanted to see it as the basis of a new international regime to combat climate change.
Copenhagen contains unprecedented progress, whether in the number of countries which have made commitments, or in the financial effort planned for developing countries. But it is a text which remains largely to be implemented.
II - Cancun must be the opportunity to transform the test.
This must be the conference of pragmatism and action.
We must quickly reach agreement on balanced decisions. We must combine support instruments - such as financing mechanisms and technology transfer - with real ambitions in the field of adaptation and mitigation.
A very transparent information exchange system must accompany this process.
We must also do everything to ensure that the international community really takes a path compatible with limiting warming to below 2°C. It is essential to anchor the commitments and carry out the actions to reduce emissions presented after Copenhagen.
In view of scientists' warnings, these commitments remain insufficient. But let's take them as a first step towards strengthening the fight against climate change, and let's not stop our march.
I am fully aware that it will still take time to reach a single legally binding agreement to achieve the objective of halving emissions. The great reunification that we all hope for must remain our ambition. We must move forward in this direction now. In the meantime, we are applying the Bali road map and the European Union is ready to commit to a second period under the Kyoto Protocol, beyond 2012. This is an approach that France fully supports.
I would not understand if we were not moving forward clearly on this point, here in Cancun.
Beyond that, the response to climate change, we know, must be based on broader and equitably distributed commitments.
III To support the efforts of developing countries in the fight against climate change, the implementation of concrete and immediate actions is fundamental.
France has thus committed to mobilizing 420 million euros per year, including 20% ​​for forests, over three years as pilot funding. This year, it launched the REDD+ Partnership with Norway, which brings together more than 70 forestry countries and donors and mobilizes $4 billion over three years. It has already committed several tens of millions of euros to support concrete reforestation or sustainable forest management projects in southern countries.
Following the same logic, France and Kenya yesterday launched a global partnership on access to clean energy in Africa and in the most vulnerable countries.
France also welcomes the work of the high-level group on financing set up by the UN Secretary General. The report makes it possible to observe that the mobilization of the 100 billion dollars, announced in Copenhagen, is possible through innovative financing in particular. We must follow up on this work, within the international bodies concerned. I am of course thinking of the G20. France will be mobilized on this issue as part of its presidency in 2011.
We absolutely must make strong and clear decisions in Cancun. This is the condition for success in Durban next year. This is also the condition for the Rio+20 Conference in 2012 to allow progress on green growth and international environmental governance.
We cannot afford to fail. We must find an agreement together that allows us to make concrete progress in the fight against global warming. The stakes are high, so is our responsibility."
"Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to speak frankly.
There is one point that unites us all, and that is that the failure of Copenhagen would be catastrophic for each of us. Whatever our starting positions, failure is absolutely forbidden to us. We would all be accountable to world public opinion and to our public opinion.
Scientists told us what to do, they told us we were the last generation that could do it. Failure is forbidden.
Second thing, we must change gear for this conference or we are headed straight for disaster. The Copenhagen Conference cannot consist of a succession of speeches that never confront each other. We are not here for a conference on global warming, we are here to make decisions.
I therefore request that after dinner this evening, there be a meeting of key leaders from all regions of the world to finally negotiate seriously on a compromise text. There are less than 24 hours left. If we continue like this, we will fail. We need a real working meeting, at the level of decision-makers.
Third remark, we all have to make compromises, all of us, Europe and the rich countries, we have to recognize that in the pollution of the planet, our responsibility is heavier and more serious than the others and therefore that our commitments must be stronger.
The United States of America, the world's leading power, will have to go beyond the commitments it has announced, even if these commitments mark significant progress.
China, which has already announced things, cannot consider that the transparency of everyone's efforts is a challenge to everyone's sovereignty.
Finally, the elements of the compromise are known.
Who will dare to say that Africa and the poorest countries do not need the money, the 10 billion dollars for the first three years and the 100 billion euros from 2020?
Who will dare to say that he is against this money being given to the poorest? Who will dare to say it, on this platform or elsewhere?
I tell my African friends, if we do not have an agreement, you will be the first victims. Don't let yourself be robbed of that deal you need.
Who will dare to say that we do not need innovative financing that will tax financial transactions to find the means to save the planet from the expected catastrophe? Who will dare to say from this platform: “we don’t need innovative financing”?
Third element, who will dare to tell this forum that we do not need an organization, whose nature and composition we can debate to our satisfaction, to compare the respect of each person's commitments?
Who will dare to say that transparency is for all humanity except for him? Who will dare to say it? Who will dare to come to this platform to say that?
Who will dare to say that the two degrees of increase in temperature do not involve reducing emissions by 50%, including 80% for us rich countries, because we have a historic responsibility? Who will dare to challenge this historical reality? Who will dare to challenge it?
Who will dare to dispute the fact that of the money that we are prepared to use, we must give a significant part of it to countries which have this universal good which are forests and which do not have the means to manage the cost of the management of this world heritage of humanity? Who will dare to say it? Who will dare to come here to challenge this reality?
Who will dare to dispute that the poor countries of Africa, the poor countries of Asia, even India, do not need the money that we are prepared to mobilize and that they cannot be treated in the same way? conditions as these giants of tomorrow and today, Brazil or China? Who will dare to say it?
I hope you understand me, My Dear Friends, time is working against us. Let's stop posturing, let's really get into the negotiation. Some want to keep Kyoto, let's keep Kyoto. Others love the text of the Maltese negotiator, let's keep the text, but let's agree on a political umbrella which more or less takes up the political commitments that I have just spoken about.
Let us negotiate hard tonight and tomorrow, let us all ratify the agreement that has been reached and give ourselves six months after the Copenhagen Conference to transform these political commitments into a legal text.
Ladies and gentlemen, not a single one of us will get through this if we do not live up to the historic responsibility of Copenhagen. The question is asked now, right away. You have to start negotiating right away. Know in any case that France and Europe are ready for it.
Thank you."
"Seen from Poznan, the information is rather good, even if the discussions in Brussels continue this morning, but the points of view got closer yesterday. No, we will be on this range, the "three 20s"" are guaranteed. The question is rather the modalities, how we get there, and there, obviously, each Member State can have its point of view or its particular local problems. There are Member States which have more coal in. their electricity, others who are less well connected to the European market, who can exchange electricity less easily. There are specific issues regarding the industry, but the objectives are maintained, and that is very good. important for Europe, but it is very important for the world, we see it from here, in Poznan, since the international negotiations on the fight against climate change. I believe that politically failure is not possible. that is to say we need This agreement is ecologically not possible. Europe is a leader in the world in the fight against climate change, so Europe must demonstrate that it is possible. This agreement is both its contribution to the fight against climate change, it will be 20% less greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 for a group which still represents 15% of global emissions, so it's important. But it is also a very strong signal that Europe is sending to other countries in the world, which is to say: while we, we Europeans, are so different in our economic and cultural situations, in our situations vis-à-vis very different energy goals, we have managed to do it, so the whole world can do it. That's what I'm saying at the moment, Poznan is: be careful, the interior of Europe... Europe is not homogeneous, Europe is very, very countries, very different. So, if Europe can do it, that means the whole world can do it. The United States is eagerly awaited for its return to the international scene and to international negotiations on climate change. And the problem with the Bush administration is not only that it was not very "warm", very willing, it is that in fact it was very little present. We had American delegations who came almost as observers, they did not ratify the Kyoto protocol, they participated very little in the discussion, and in the end they blocked it. So there, we need both an administration that is much more mobilized, and we feel it, the echoes we have from Washington are that this is going to be the case, they really want to make proposals on the subject. And then, we also need an administration which is much more present, which is a driving force in these negotiations, because, when the United States is there almost as an observer, it creates a kind of inertia, it creates a weight , it can't work. It's almost the opposite. Obviously, there is this idea: there is an economic crisis, there is no more money, so we are not going to put any into the environment; it's a dated idea, it's an idea from the past, and it's an idea that is very underdeveloped. Here, in Poznan for example, industrialists came together, they wrote a paper to say: we consider that the economic crisis should not slow down the fight against climate change, on the contrary it is an opportunity. This may seem paradoxical, but at a time of economic crisis, we need to overhaul the system of production and consumption anyway, we know that we are in a series of impasses, this is the opportunity to reinvest. Let's reinvest in the environment, let's take the opportunity to reinvest in a low-carbon economy. This is the message sent by the most mobilized States in the world, but it is also the message sent by the most active industrialists, and there are more and more of them all the same. They won't all be in Poznan, and there are some... But the tendency is that it's still a rearguard battle. It's a rearguard battle because energy prices are increasingly fluctuating, but businesses need predictability. So, becoming low-carbon, becoming more energy efficient, means becoming more competitive, in fact, giving ourselves new competitiveness. And then, it's a rearguard fight because, the problems that we are faced with, in France or in Europe, of fighting for the preservation of the environment, against climate change, the whole world is there. confronted. Look at the Chinese for example, they announced that in 2020, half of the cars they would put on the Chinese market would be electric cars. The Chinese are far ahead on electric cars. So, these questions that we ask ourselves are all countries in the world. If we develop the patents, if we develop the equipment, if we develop the products to respond to them, we will be able to sell them to countries around the world, and manufacturers know it.

"Mr. President of the Conference,
Ladies and Gentlemen Ministers,
Ladies and gentlemen negotiators,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I thank the Indonesian Government for hosting this conference of the parties in such good conditions.
Our obligation is clear: here in Bali, we must adopt a road map, an imperative negotiating mandate on the four major blocs, including the fight against deforestation, forest degradation and desertification, and on clear and figures for reducing emissions from industrialized countries. Otherwise it would be a great defeat for humanity.
This is why I would like to address those industrialized countries who are hesitant to clearly commit to a reduction of 25% to 40% by 2020 of their greenhouse gas emissions, while counting on the mechanisms economic and market, on technologies, to achieve this.
I tell them: the markets, your companies, your researchers, consumers, need clear signs, standards, incentives, visibility and readability:
- standards on renewable energies;
- standards on the energy performance of buildings;
- automobile emissions standards.
I tell them: low-carbon development is a lever for growth, it is even the main one, because growth is always responding to a pressing need and saving the planet is one of them.
Have confidence in your economy, the men and women of your countries, their own genius. As soon as the reduction objective is defined, public and known, your entire economy will start working efficiently.
In the same way, support for technology transfer must imperatively be found. This will push towards new innovations and better performance.
Refusing to commit to figures and dates would mean not having confidence in your own model, your own technologies to offer low-carbon progress.
Yes, it is time for international commitments. And if meetings of the largest economies are held, this approach must be accompanied by quantified commitments from industrialized countries. Otherwise, the discussion of means without objectives risks adding to the incomprehension.
My country, France, is in total harmony with the position of the European Union, obviously.
* 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and up to 30% under certain conditions;
* Halving global emissions by 2050;
* 25% to 40% reduction in emissions from industrialized countries by 2020.
France has honored its commitments in Annex 1. And France, which aims to go from 8.8 to 6.9 t per inhabitant per year by 2020, and to 2 t by 2050, is ready to consider accelerating its move towards a 30% reduction, while also hoping that by Copenhagen:
- all industrialized countries commit to the conditions defined by the IPCC;
- major emerging countries engage in a process enabling sectoral agreements to be concluded, for example in the field of energy, and are moving towards reducing the increase in their greenhouse gas emissions before stabilization .
Ladies and Gentlemen, conferences of the parties and all international negotiations are essential and vital processes, managing globalities and complexities that are general and sometimes legal in nature.
But the greatest scarcity is time.
This should therefore not distract us from practical, operational and immediate implementation. Let's each do immediately what we know how to do:
- through sectoral agreements: on aluminum, cement, steel, etc.
- through energy performance projects,
- by the gradual introduction of an ecological price in trade,
- through the development of renewable energies.
We organized a major stakeholders' conference in France, the Grenelle de l'environnement, with citizens, NGOs, unions, businesses, to define operational measures.
France will also support vital programs to combat deforestation and forest degradation, as well as desertification and land degradation.
This is why I believe that we need an emergency committee, to identify the most urgent needs, the available capacities, and implement all these projects without delay.
I welcome the progress on the adaptation fund. Sustainable financial resources are needed. I am in favor of seriously studying the establishment of innovative and dedicated financing, in particular the possibility of a levy on global financial flows.
I have a dream: it is that in Copenhagen, the same applause that greeted Australia's ratification of the Kyoto protocol here greets the commitment of other major economies. It’s a matter of progress, it’s a matter of justice.”
"Mr. President,
Mr President of the conference,
Ladies and Gentlemen Ministers and Heads of Delegations,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
You are gathered in Nairobi to make the necessary decisions in the face of climate change. I wanted to express to you France's great concern and determination.
Mr. Nicholas Stern's recent report quantifies for the first time the impressive cost of inaction. It demonstrates, if necessary, the urgency of immediate and ambitious collective action. And the truth is that international mobilization remains woefully insufficient.
Certainly, more than 160 countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. But its implementation is today seriously compromised, even though it reflects minimal commitment.
It is compromised by the large industrialized countries which have refused to enter into the logic of collective action and are allowing their greenhouse gas emissions to increase.
It is compromised by those who ratified it and who are now going back on their commitment or who are not respecting its provisions.
It is compromised by all those who, whether industrialized or emerging countries, refuse the prospect of long-term quantified commitments.
It is undermined by anyone who claims that vague voluntary commitments or a technological miracle will be enough to solve the problem.
France has taken all its responsibilities. Because continuing to do nothing would be irresponsible. This would allow climate change to become a threat not only to development, but even to international peace and security.
This is why France ensures that it strictly respects the obligations it has undertaken under the Kyoto Protocol. Its CO2 emissions, which represent less than 40% of the average for OECD countries, have been stabilized. For the long term, it is committed to reducing them by 75% by 2050. We have, with the report on "Factor 4" by Christian de Boissieu, data which demonstrates that this is achievable. economically, without weighing on growth. France is already preparing the incentive and regulatory measures necessary to achieve this objective.
The Kyoto Protocol is in fact only a first step. A new framework for action is necessary for the period beginning in 2012. With the European Union, France proposes the establishment of an effective and strengthened multilateral regime.
It will have to set even more ambitious emissions reduction commitments for all industrialized countries from 2012.
It will need to better involve emerging countries, whose emissions are growing rapidly, and lead them to adopt more low-carbon economic growth models. Technology transfers must be facilitated to those who are involved.
It will have to adopt a regime to help the poorest countries adapt to climate change.
It must, even better than the Kyoto Protocol, combine the use of market instruments with the use of taxation and regulatory commitments.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Under the pretext that the predicted catastrophes have not materialized, some would like us to refrain from acting, would like to maintain the illusion that they will be able to exempt themselves from the common effort as if by magic.
But the choice is not between economic growth and the fight against climate change. It is between climate catastrophe and environmentally friendly development.
Let's stop seeing the fight against climate change as a constraint! Faced with climate degradation and the scarcity of natural resources, let us understand that the future belongs to those who invent a mode of economic growth that restores the ecological balance of the planet.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I will bring together in Paris, in February 2007, those who want to be at the forefront of an international mobilization to carry this vision of our common future. I hope that your work here in Nairobi will be part of this ambition, serving future generations.
Thank you."
"Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear friends,
I am very happy to open this French “side-event”, or to speak in our language, this “parallel event”. We have decided to dedicate this side event to “multi-actor cooperation” in the service of the climate.
I would indeed like, on this occasion, to show you that everyone in France is committed to the climate: businesses, Government, NGOs?
My remarks will therefore revolve around the actions of these different actors and I will try to show concrete examples of actions on their part.
To help me in this task, I have by my side Adrien ZELLER, President of the Regional Council of Alsace, who will present to us the very proactive policy he is leading.
I also have at my side:
Marc-Antoine MARTIN, Secretary General of the French Fund for the Global Environment,
François MOISAN, Executive Director of Strategy and Research at ADEME,
Claude NAHON, Director of Environment and Sustainable Development at EDF.
I also thank the Convention Secretariat for kindly hosting this special event.
1 - The climate is, first of all, a strong ambition of the French Government
For a long time, France has had a strong policy of energy management and low-carbon energy.
France has “low-carbon” electricity production due to nuclear energy and hydraulics.
It is also one of the leading producers and consumers of renewable energies in Europe, particularly thanks to biomass and hydraulics.
Furthermore, in the field of transport, it has one of the least emitting vehicle fleets in Europe: 153 grams of CO2 per kilometer for a European average of 162 grams per kilometer. This is thanks in particular to small diesel vehicles which are sold by French manufacturers.
Some figures on our greenhouse gas emissions:
French emissions are currently 557 million equivalent tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted each year.
France is currently on the right trajectory compared to Kyoto.
But if we do nothing, emissions will increase by around 10% by 2010, or 54 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.
The Climate Plan of July 2004. Objective: comply with the Kyoto protocol
The Climate Plan, put in place by the Government in July 2004, brings together measures in all sectors of the economy and the daily life of the French with a view to saving 54 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. horizon 2010, in order to significantly influence the growing trend in consumption.
The Energy Law of 2005
The new Energy Law which was passed in July 2005 sets the objective of dividing our greenhouse gas emissions by four by 2050. It also sets the annual rate of decline in energy intensity of 0.8% per year today to 2% per year by 2015. This corresponds to a reduction of 3% per year in our carbon dioxide emissions.
Two sectors to look closely at: transport and housing
* respectively +22% and +14% increase between 1990 and 2003
The Climate Plan has implemented strong measures, particularly in these two sectors.
These are “diffuse” sectors, on which it is more difficult to act through regulation than in “concentrated” sectors such as industry or electricity production.
We cannot restrict the freedom of every citizen. We cannot force every French person to drive an ecological car. But the State can encourage citizens to make the right choices.
The State has therefore put in place a certain number of incentives, particularly tax incentives, to act in these sectors.
In transport:
* the development of biofuels at 7% in 2010, which shows strong ambition.
* support for research actions on clean and economical vehicles. The research effort in clean and economical transport is substantial (20 million euros annually paid since 2004) and has just been reinforced (100 million euros).
Of course, France is continuing its policy of developing the TGV, which offers a low-carbon means of transport.
In the building:
* the strengthening of the tax credit, that is to say targeted tax reductions on energy efficiency and renewable energies mainly thermal, represents support for households of around €300 million.
* Furthermore, French policy is moving towards market tools through the establishment in 2006 of a system of white certificates (Energy Savings Certificates) assigning an energy saving obligation to all energy suppliers including fuel oil of 54 terawatt hours.
In a more transversal manner, the 2004 Climate Plan decided:
* the generalization of the energy label from A to G applied primarily to vehicles and buildings.
* strengthening research on new energy technologies within programs led in particular by the National Research Agency.
The objective of this new agency created in 2005 is to promote public-private partnerships between manufacturers and public research centers (IFP for biofuels, CEA for nuclear and hydrogen, BRGM for sequestration ?)
* In the field of buildings, the PREBAT program sets the objective of widespread use of buildings consuming less than 50 kilowatt hours per square meter in primary energy from 2020.
* Finally, the Climate Plan defined a reference framework for communities to implement their policies for reducing emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change: Territorial Climate Plans.
Beyond these 2010s, we must look to 2050: the challenge of division by 4
The objective taken in Kyoto to stabilize our greenhouse gas emissions represents only a first step. We must aim to divide our emissions by four by 2050.
The President of the Republic Jacques Chirac is committed to this for France.
This is why I set up, with my colleague the Minister of Industry François LOOS, a group of experts responsible for studying economically realistic scenarios which will allow us to achieve this drastic objective.
The presidency of this group of experts was entrusted to Mr. Christian de BOISSIEU. He will submit his conclusions in spring 2006.
Furthermore, the Government will develop, by mid-2006, a 2006 Climate Plan, which will update the Climate Plan with all the new measures announced since; and which will include a component at the 2050 deadline.
2 - Strong new measures announced by the Prime Minister strengthen the Climate Plan
Current energy prices and the urgency of climate change have already pushed the Government to act and strengthen the 2004 Climate Plan this year.
This is why new and strong measures were put in place by the Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin, on September 1, and during the 2005 Climate Meetings.
These measures help to increase the energy independence of our country, and to improve behavior.
Allow me to recall them because each of these measures has an impact on the daily life of the French.
- a reinforced tax credit for energy savings and renewable energies
* this tax credit was put in place by the Climate Plan and has been in force since the beginning of this year. Reimbursement rates will be increased from next year;
* for insulation materials and condensing boilers they will increase to 40%, instead of 25%;
* for renewable energies such as solar water heaters they will increase to 50% instead of 40%; This is very strong support given in particular to the solar sector.
- a reinforced tax credit for clean cars
* Vehicles aided by tax credit (hybrid, LPG and CNG) will be aided to the tune of 2000? instead of 1525?.
* a major Research and Development program of 100 million euros for a fuel-efficient vehicle with the objective of creating a family car emitting less than 100 grams of CO2 per km, which does not exist today.
- additional means to boost public transport
100 million euros in subsidies from the AFITF (Transport Infrastructure Financing Agency in France) for collective transport on own sites in the provinces and 300 million euros in loans on preferential conditions from the Caisse des Dépôts will be added for also finance collective transport projects on their own sites.
- achieve the objective of 5.75% biofuels from 2008
The Biofuels Plan will be accelerated by new calls for tender which will allow us to reach the rate of 5.75% from 2008 instead of 2010.
- an increase in the registration tax on vehicle registration documents for vehicles that emit high amounts of CO2
This increase is targeted at private vehicles which emit more than 200 grams of CO2 per km, or 8% of sales. Today, family vehicles are available below this threshold: it is therefore a question of encouraging the purchase of clean vehicles.
This is therefore a strong incentive to buy vehicles with lower emissions.
- the increase in the photovoltaic electricity purchase price by 50% for individuals and 100% for collective projects;
- a research program on energy-efficient buildings making it possible to renovate, within five years, housing emitting less than 50 kWh/m²; and build new “positive energy” buildings.
3 - Business involvement
After the involvement of the Government, I would also like to talk to you about the involvement of French companies.
Indeed, the time when we had to oppose economy and ecology is long gone. Today, companies can be flagships serving a new economy, more respectful of the planet.
Large French groups are already strongly committed in this area. They launched a voluntary AERES agreement, which anticipated the establishment of the European emissions trading system. It is also the sector which has made the biggest decline since 1990 (-22%).
French companies then participated in the establishment of the European quota market. 1,100 sites in France are affected. This market for CO2 quotas was created at the beginning of 2005. It has proven to be particularly active, with a carbon price which is now around 20 euros per tonne of CO2.
The first period of this market (2005-2007) is a period of experimentation. A consultation has just been launched with manufacturers to develop quotas for the second period (2008-2012).
Furthermore, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations has just submitted a set of proposals so that companies can carry out domestic projects which contribute to reducing the greenhouse effect in other economic sectors such as transport, buildings or agriculture. We will try to ensure that these new mechanisms can see the light of day next year.
The CO2 Action Group
Under the joint leadership of MEDEF and the Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development, several major French industrialists created this year an association, the Group'Action CO2, responsible for bringing together and amplifying their research efforts on CO2 emissions and encourage the creation of joint actions.
The Group'Action CO2 is chaired by Pierre GADONNEIX, president of EDF. I believe this shows the involvement of the first French electrician in the service of the climate.
In the construction sector in particular, the industrialists of Group'Action CO2 are identifying levers for a reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030.
Claude NAHON, director of sustainable development at Ademe, will have the opportunity to tell us more about her actions at Group'Action CO2 later.
4 - The involvement of French local authorities
In a moment I will give the floor to Adrien ZELLER, president of the Alsace Regional Council, who will present his lively and concrete experience to us.
But let me tell you a few words about the role of local authorities in France.
The role of local authorities
Communities have a big role to play here as public policy makers. By the equipment decisions they make, in respect of the assets they manage (buildings, public lighting, vehicle fleets) and due to the activities for which they provide management skills (transport, waste, distribution of energy, particularly via district heating), communities intervene directly in around 12% of greenhouse gas emissions.
This is why we have planned, to implement the National Climate Plan, to allow each city, in each department, in each region a Territorial Climate Plan.
The Territorial Climate Plan is a voluntary framework for any territory to bring together and coordinate all of its policies in terms of energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond this “mitigation component”, the Territorial Climate Plan will also include an “adaptation component” in order to assess the vulnerability of the territory to climate change.
Of course, many communities did not wait for the Climate Plan to act on energy, housing, transport, some have even already launched initiatives. In order to illustrate this local dynamic, I am particularly happy that the President of the Alsace Region is testifying to their approach here in Montreal. Territorial Climate Plans are being implemented today in France.
The role of the State in supporting community initiatives
In order to encourage these initiatives and enable their multiplication, the State, notably through the Environment and Energy Management Agency, supports communities in these initiatives by making available to them a certain number of tools.
My ministry has just published a Guide to help communities develop Territorial Climate Plans.
To enable the precise quantification of emissions, ADEME is developing the Bilan Carbone-Collectivités & Territoires.
It is being tested in thirteen communities in the regions of Alsace, Aquitaine, Burgundy, Centre, Franche-Comté, Ile-de-France, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Poitou-Charentes and Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur.
5 - French cooperation on climate
After talking about national action, the role played by businesses and communities, I would like to talk about international cooperation.
We will win the climate battle if we are united internationally, not if France is isolated.
This is why France is carrying out numerous cooperation actions on this theme.
* 1st example: The France / Lithuania agreement
I will give you as an example the agreement that I signed on October 18 with my Lithuanian counterpart, Mr. Arunas Kundrotas, sealing the friendship between our two countries.
Links have been strengthened since 2004 around a joint project led by the French Fund for the Global Environment (FFEM) in Lithuania on the theme of the fight against climate change. This project concretizes the structuring of a regional wood-energy sector in the south of Lithuania and has concretely resulted in the replacement of fossil fuels by the installation of wood boilers in two medium-sized towns.
This cooperation will be continued and extended to other areas of the environment and sustainable development.
* 2nd example: Decentralized cooperation in Reunion
Cooperation also takes place at the decentralized level, here we can highlight the initiative of the Réunion Region which has just launched a regional cooperation exercise aimed at a strategy of progressive energy autonomy for the islands and regions as a response to face changes climatic.
I would like to welcome this type of initiative because there is indeed a lot of exchange of experiences to be made between the French overseas regions and the island states.
6 - Finally, adaptation is the second essential component of a climate policy
We know today that climate change is happening and that even if we stop our greenhouse gas emissions, our essential facilities, infrastructure and services will be affected.
The drama of the summer 2003 heatwave
France experienced floods and a heat wave in 2003 which caused 30,000 deaths in Europe (15,000 in France). Adapting your territory and making it less vulnerable to present and future hazards is a necessity. It is even a way to raise awareness among as many people as possible about the urgency of taking action.
Creation of ONERC
France, particularly sensitive to the problem of adaptation, created ONERC (the National Observatory of the Effects of Global Warming) in 2001, responsible for presenting an annual report to Parliament, and implementing a strategy for adaptation.
The National Adaptation Strategy
Beyond a mitigation policy (reduction of greenhouse gases), an adaptation strategy consists of reducing the harmful consequences of climate change.
Action in key areas must begin now to ensure buildings and infrastructure remain sustainable in a changing climate.
The 2004 Climate Plan entrusted ONERC with a mission to coordinate adaptation to the effects of global warming in France and asked it to prepare an adaptation strategy.
In view of the challenges and major goals pursued by the adaptation strategy, eight strategic areas of action have been identified:
* Develop knowledge
Research is only just beginning on the subject of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation. Particular effort must be made to assess the costs of impacts and adaptation.
* Consolidate the impact observation system in the form of regularly updated databases and indicators.
* Inform the public, elected officials, and facilitate access to expert information
* Promote a territorialized approach
Taking into consideration adaptation to climate change is still largely absent from territorial concerns, which therefore need to be focused on this subject.
* Finance adaptation actions
There is no specific mechanism to finance or encourage the implementation of actions to adapt to climate change. Such a mechanism should be created
* Use legislative and regulatory instruments
The application of existing regulations intended to prevent the harmful effects of climate variability needs to be evaluated in the light of the new climate situation, as well as the climate references on which these regulations are based.
* Take into account the specificity of overseas territories, which are confronted more frequently than mainland France with extreme climatic events.
* Contribute to international exchanges
A draft Strategy resulting from a working group bringing together all the ministries was put out for public consultation during the summer of 2005 and will soon be submitted for approval to the Government.
This National Adaptation Strategy will make it possible to develop a real adaptation program.
This problem must be the subject of concrete, on-the-ground actions, particularly by local authorities. I hope that the National Adaptation Strategy prepared by ONERC will make it possible to initiate these concrete actions.
CONCLUSION
I thank you all for your involvement.
This multi-actor cooperation is absolutely necessary for us to succeed in meeting the formidable challenge of climate change. We implemented it in France, but it can undoubtedly be exported to other countries; and one of the goals of this afternoon's meeting is precisely to encourage exchanges.
I would like to thank everyone who came to Montreal to represent France, its businesses, its communities.
You have understood: France wishes to send a very strong message and rally the greatest number of partners during this Montreal conference. The President of the Republic proved it yesterday by delivering a speech of firmness and will. I am convinced that a dynamic is being created and I currently have numerous bilateral meetings with my counterparts (Americans, Chinese, Indians in particular), and this morning with the community of French-speaking countries to move things forward. "
"We are here at the round table on Climate Change and Sustainable Development and we are working within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Indeed, the final objective of the Convention, which is to stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that is not dangerous for humanity, is closely linked to sustainable development, and must be included in the Delhi Declaration.
A second point must then appear in the Declaration, this is the basis that constitutes the work of the IPCC. They tell us that climate change is underway, and that it is urgent to act, as Jacques Chirac reminded us at the Johannesburg Summit.
Next, let us keep in mind that, in the very near future, without a drastic reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions, of the order of half before the end of the century, adaptation would quickly find its limits. The European Union, for its part, is considering a long-term reduction of 70% of its emissions, in compliance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities of the Climate Change convention. France has exceeded its stabilization objective, and in 2001 is 2% below 1990 in absolute values.
Technologies and organizations that are energy efficient and emit little or no greenhouse gases contribute to sustainable development, by combining economic efficiency, preservation of natural resources and protection of human beings. For several decades now, we have known that economic development can very well be decoupled from the quantity of resources consumed. We must therefore strengthen the conditions favorable to the development and dissemination of these organizations and these techniques, ensuring that local development constitutes a criterion of their choice. We can already count on the tools created by the Kyoto Protocol and the Marrakech agreements, such as the Clean Development Mechanism, to do this; this must also be included in the Delhi declaration.
To participate in this dissemination of technologies and good practices, France has just decided to devote 385,000 Euros for the rapid start of the CDM, and 850,000 Euros to the fund for Less Developed Countries. Furthermore, it paid 164 million Euros for the third replenishment of the GEF. Finally, the French Fund for the Global Environment devotes 5 million Euros per year, including 42% for Saharan Africa and 15% for the Mediterranean. We are here at the heart of the issue of Sustainable Development and Climate Change. These contributions, and compliance with our Bonn commitment, are part of the political objective of increasing national public development assistance by 50% in 5 years.
Sustainable development is built concretely on a daily basis, but must also be guided by a medium-term and long-term vision. In our opinion, this translates into two directions in the climate field:
- better adaptation to ongoing climate change in all countries, and particularly in the most vulnerable and least equipped to respond to it;
- a drastic reduction in greenhouse gases leading to a globally equitable approach for the distribution of emissions in the long term, i.e. high reduction commitments for industrialized countries, and for countries which are not yet industrialized , more efficient and less emitting development trajectories.
These are fundamental points for the Delhi Declaration.
The ways remain to be found, to be debated, so that we can succeed in achieving the common objective: a rapid stabilization of the climate which keeps the rise in temperatures below 2 degrees. The Declaration must make it possible to open dialogue on these avenues, in any case, success requires information and public awareness in all countries. The ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by all, and its entry into force are an essential point of the Final Declaration. Believing in sustainable development without significant reductions in emissions from the main emitters is illusory.
We therefore strongly hope that this conference contributes to accelerating dialogue and international action, to build together a low-energy, equitable and sustainable world, whose greenhouse emissions do not exceed the capacities of the planet, nor of human beings.
Mr. President, thank you."
First of all, Dear Wim KOK, I would like to associate myself unreservedly with the tribute that you were kind enough to pay to the sandbag, it is a symbol, but life is made of symbols. And, also, completely subscribe to this beautiful motto of the Rotterdam football club, which in its simplicity is perfectly understandable and effective. I arrive in The Hague, in fact, carried by a feeling of urgency. Yesterday's hypotheses have been verified. Scientists are now clear: global warming has begun, a consequence of the prodigious concentration, over a century, of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. This is an anthropogenic phenomenon, since man caused it. A cumulative phenomenon, since man makes it worse. But also, fortunately, a phenomenon that can still be controlled, since man can remedy it, provided he acts firmly and now. It is up to all of us to react vigorously before the point of no return is reached. It is up to us to contain greenhouse gas emissions within sustainable limits to keep the earth welcoming for future generations. This is the objective of the Kyoto Protocol. The Hague Conference must take decisions that will allow its ratification and entry into force in 2002. Since 1992, we have fallen too far behind in the fight against global warming. Now there is danger in the house. This is why, I can confirm to you, Europe is mobilized against the greenhouse effect, it is determined to act. Europe calls on other industrialized countries to join it in this fight. Europe offers developing countries a partnership for sustainable development. * * * It is time for action. Everyone clearly sees the terrible consequences that inertia and procrastination would ultimately have. Disappearance of regulatory mechanisms, such as the Gulf Stream which gives Europe its temperate climate. Rising sea levels which would threaten certain islands and archipelagos; destruction of coral reefs; invasion by water of the most exposed coasts and deltas, which are privileged areas for human settlement in many parts of the world Extinction of animal and plant species, and therefore impoverishment of biodiversity. Without forgetting, of course, the increasingly frequent climatic aberrations: storms, typhoons, cyclones, floods, with their procession of victims and destruction. Extension of deserts. Appearance of “ecological refugees” fleeing natural disasters. Triggering of conflicts for the possession of rarefied resources. These worrying developments, whose main victims would be people who are already very hard-pressed, should not be reasons for discouragement but reasons to act quickly. Without this, we would be guilty of failing to help our planet in danger. Of course, there are the inevitable difficulties of adaptation and the constraints of necessary development. Of course, there are pressures from those who are satisfied with laxity or immobility, the immediate interests of those who profit from wasted energy. But we must move on. Today, in The Hague, the international community represented by environment ministers from around the world has a moral and political duty to move in the right direction. * Eight years ago, the Rio Summit raised high hopes. Developed countries promised to stabilize their greenhouse gas emissions. The others committed to exploring new development strategies. Eight years later, the results are disappointing. Everywhere, the situation has worsened. The Convention on Climate Change was adopted in the name of the precautionary principle, at a time when scientists were still wondering about the nature of the phenomenon. Since then, its confirmation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, on the basis of ever finer and ever more reliable studies, has not sufficiently mobilized our energies and strengthened our will. Likewise, the compromise found in Kyoto three years ago is far from having borne fruit. Despite the commitments made, despite Buenos Aires two years ago and Lyon a few weeks ago, everyone sticks to their own positions and interests. Each, in a way, waits for the other. * Today, we face our responsibilities. Are we going to let our emissions grow, even though the IPCC is warning us about their consequences? Are we going to let the gap between rich and poor countries widen even further, the former adapting at the cost of colossal defensive investments, the latter suffering because they do not have the means to modify their practices and policies? ? It is a question of knowing, once again, if we want to control and regulate globalization in order to make it fairer and more humane. If the capacity to act is lacking in the South, the will to act is too often lacking in the North. While recognizing the personal commitment of President CLINTON, I want to recall here the reality of the figures. The United States alone produces a quarter of global emissions. Each American emits three times more greenhouse gases than each French person. It is primarily to the Americans that hope for an effective limitation of greenhouse gases on a global scale is directed. I therefore call on the United States of America to put aside their doubts and hesitations. The time has come for them to join the major industrialized countries, to jointly succeed in the transition to a low-energy economy, which, however, will lose none of its vitality. For a long time, the history of industrial civilization was that of the struggle against natural constraints, climate, distances or the scarcity of resources. Today, we must put the creative force of modern economies at the service of the fight against climate change, the new frontier of our development. This would be a strong gesture towards the countries of the South. They are waiting, and rightly so, for the developed countries, which alone emit two-thirds of greenhouse gases, to get to the front line. They are also waiting for reassurance about their future. We must prove to them that the Kyoto mechanisms will not hinder their development. Better, that they will work for their benefit. It is premature to demand quantified commitments from them. But the time is approaching when their economic level will justify it, at the rate of everyone's progress. North-South solidarity means a North reducing its emissions so that the South develops at the cost of controlled growth of its own. * Aware of its responsibilities, the European Union will play its full part in the common effort. It was in Europe that the industrial revolution was born, which led to the tremendous consumption of energy whose effects we are experiencing. Europeans, through their level of prosperity and know-how, must set an example by finding modes of consumption and production that are economical with natural resources. It is indeed a revolution of minds. We have built our prosperity on abundant energy. Today, we must realize that every natural resource has a cost, that all pollution is a form of waste, and that the planet's regeneration capacities are not unlimited. Saving raw materials, diversifying sources of supply, recycling waste, new materials, energy efficiency and developing renewable energies, so many choices which must inspire our policies. In Kyoto, the European Union set itself the objective of emitting 8% less greenhouse gases in 2010 than in 1990. Each country committed, in proportion to its emissions and its wealth. . Each country is responsible for its results to its European partners as well as to the parties to the Convention. In 2002, in accordance with the decisions of the European Councils, the Fifteen will ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The organs of the Union as well as each State have initiated the necessary procedures. France, for its part, brought them to fruition last July and therefore stands ready. Europe is determined to implement the provisions of this text. Thus, the Council, Parliament and the Commission are actively preparing common or coordinated policies - regulatory and fiscal instruments, budgetary incentives, research programs, educational actions - which will allow us to control our greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, each of us embarked on the development of national programs. This is the case with the French Government, which presented last February a national plan to combat the greenhouse effect and which is preparing to announce additional energy efficiency measures. For thirty years, France has engaged in a voluntary energy policy. It has had the consequence of considerably limiting its greenhouse gas emissions, which are therefore much lower than those of other large industrialized countries, in proportion to their inhabitants of course. How can we avoid increasing this pollution again at a time of renewed growth? We must tackle the most difficult sources of emissions to control: transport, buildings, housing. Of course, we will not be able to overturn structures and habits in one day. In this long-term work, we must reconcile progressiveness of the method and firmness in the objectives to be achieved. * Here in The Hague, the European Union must mobilize all its strength to reach a good agreement. A fair, effective, scalable agreement. A fair agreement is one where everyone is committed to their responsibilities. OECD countries and countries in transition must effectively reduce their emissions. Only then can they expect similar commitments from developing countries. A fair agreement is one that provides for an independent and impartial compliance mechanism, with indisputable data and able to decide on remedial political and financial penalties in the event of a breach. We will thus avoid these phenomena of "free riders" where the first efforts, accomplished with difficulty by a few, would expose them to unacceptable distortions of competition. A fair agreement is one which helps the most vulnerable to adapt to the consequences of climate change and which lays the foundations for an objective discussion on the possible harm that certain countries could suffer as a result of its application. This agreement must also be effective if we want to respect the objectives set in Kyoto for 2008-2012. The countries concerned must accomplish most of the control efforts through national or regional measures. Everyone has a duty to build structures that sustainably minimize their own emissions. No one can spare their share of the collective effort. Europe has made proposals for the application of this principle, and this principle is fundamental for it. Flexibility mechanisms will complement national efforts. They must in no way be seen as loopholes. The European Union will be very vigilant about the guarantees surrounding the emissions permit market and the functioning of the clean development mechanism. They must be rigorous so that everyone remains fully responsible for their commitments and keeps them effectively. This is the condition for the environmental credibility of the system, but also for its economic viability. To be effective, this agreement must provide strong incentives for developing countries through the financial and technology transfers it promotes. Let us pragmatically accelerate the establishment of the clean development mechanism, while also ensuring that the poorest countries in all regions of the world can effectively benefit from it. Let us mobilize at their service the resources generated by the implementation of the agreement, and in particular the proceeds of levies and sanctions. Let us prepare the reconstitution of the Global Environment Fund by reforming it so that it is more effective, allowing better consideration of the fight against the greenhouse effect. On behalf of France, I also propose that its resources be increased. Let's make controlling global warming a priority for public development assistance programs, whether bilateral, community or multilateral. In a word, let us conclude a North-South partnership for sustainable development in The Hague. Finally, the European Union wants an evolving agreement, which does not close any doors. At this stage of great uncertainty, we can only remain cautious regarding carbon sinks. But if it were confirmed that reforestation, the fight against desertification and the fight against global warming can mutually reinforce each other, then we would be wrong to forbid ourselves from this path, at least for periods of future commitment. We still need to have developed limits and rigorous scientific criteria, which make it possible to ensure a real reduction effort and the reality of the absorption power of the sinks which would be taken into account. There is also the question of emissions from international air transport which are increasing with continued growth in traffic. The "polluter pays" principle should be applied. This is one of the objectives of the kerosene tax advocated for a long time by the European Union. We cannot give it up. Finally, let's start thinking about post-Kyoto now. Tomorrow, it will be up to us to establish, in the long term, the rights and duties of each person. To progress, while respecting specificities and differences, France proposes that our work set the objective of long-term convergence of greenhouse gas emission rates, per inhabitant. This principle would ensure the lasting effectiveness, equity and solidarity of our efforts. * * * Mr. President, Majesty, Ladies and Gentlemen, For the first time, humanity is giving itself a true instrument of global government, which must find its place in this World Environmental Organization that France, that the European Union, are calling for their wishes. Time is at will. Of course, we will not solve all the problems in The Hague. But we must go as far as possible in inventing mechanisms that will guarantee the effectiveness and also the sustainability of our efforts. The time has come for lucidity and solidarity. It is for us, for our children and our grandchildren that we work here. Our responsibility is to make decisions that preserve the chances of future generations. Let us rediscover the pioneering spirit that inspired the Hague Declaration, adopted in 1989. The time has come for collective ambition. It is up to us to mobilize all stakeholders in society, and first of all to amplify the commitment of our fellow citizens. Because they are also consumers, employees, shareholders, they have all the means to bring about new ways of living and production that are less polluting. This is why we must make ecology, from a very young age, a major theme of education, a major theme of political debate, so that respect for the environment is as fundamental as the defense of our rights and of our freedoms. By acting together, by building this unprecedented instrument, the first element of authentic global governance, we serve dialogue and peace. We demonstrate our ability to jointly control our destiny, to organize our collective sovereignty on this land which is our common heritage. We implement the ethical requirements of our people. This shows the immense stakes of an agreement here in The Hague. This shows our ardent obligation to succeed. Majesty, Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you
"Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is with pleasure that I accepted the invitation from Michel Mousel, President of the Interministerial Mission on the Greenhouse Effect, to participate in this day of discussion on the economic impacts and opportunities highlighted by international negotiations. on the greenhouse effect.
Through my contacts with some of you, but also through numerous working meetings that my office or my services have been able to hold, we have already been able to discuss this theme on multiple occasions since Kyoto, but without having the possibility of discuss it globally.
This morning was able to give you an overview of the various open questions in this negotiation, which undoubtedly promises to be long, beyond the next deadline in Buenos Aires.
A few weeks before this new stage, I would like to emphasize a few points here.
First of all, the challenge of combating the greenhouse effect is global. Only a profound change in our energy consumption patterns and other practices leading to the emission of greenhouse gases will make it possible to achieve a global reduction objective in the long term. This can only be done by taking into account the constraints of developed countries but also the legitimate needs of developing countries. The demographic prospects of the latter cannot, in fact, allow them to take the same paths as us. For us, delaying the change in our emission profiles, particularly those of the largest emitters, means making future negotiations even more difficult. This also increases the macroeconomic cost of this commitment, and reduces our ability to preserve some comparative advantages.
Secondly, a relevant policy for controlling the greenhouse effect must effectively combine regulatory and institutional tools, economic tools and technological development tools. This combination, this "policy mix", must be defined without prejudice: it is not a question of being for or against "flexibility", just as one would be for or against "rigidity". "".
This clever combination concerns all sectors. It must also identify and develop opportunities that correspond to France's position, which is not always that of its competitors and partners, particularly those located outside the European Union.
Thirdly, I will focus on the essential themes which will undoubtedly punctuate the negotiations to come, in particular the next stage in Buenos Aires, and on the priorities that I wish to defend, within the European team.
1°) The challenge of combating the greenhouse effect is global
The reality of the impact of human activities on the climate no longer raises serious dispute, and the prospective study which was distributed to you this morning, recently carried out by the MIES and by my ministry, opens a debate on its potential consequences for France. Faced with this analysis, we must take up a double challenge.
1- bend the curve of greenhouse gas emissions in the most developed countries. Only the relaunch of a policy of energy management, in all aspects of economic and industrial activity, will allow a progressive smoothing of the effort that our societies must undertake;
2- allow, at the same time, countries in transition or developing countries, which will continue to experience strong demographic growth, to adopt "sustainable" development policies, that is to say without repeating the mistakes that we were able to commit, and benefiting from active support from our developed countries, including through economic cooperation.
The global objective is not small: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a third. This can only be conceived over time, given the inertia of economic and industrial systems. As the ship has a significant "turn" radius, it is all the more crucial to identify the right course now and send the right signals to all stakeholders.
The equation to be solved therefore seems simple, even if its solution is not: immediately reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, which involves the performance of our processes, and our consumption patterns, way to allow, in the medium term, a fair sharing of the effort.
In this regard and I will return to it, I consider that the reintroduction, in international negotiations, of a long-term emission objective and of an objective and transparent mechanism for monitoring convergences, constitutes one of the challenges of negotiation, to which Europe and France must attach themselves.
2°) Given the French situation, what industrial issues and what policies?
I know that the presentations by Michel Mousel and Pierre BOISSON have already outlined the broad outlines of the French situation and its possible developments.
Pierre BOISSON chaired a major prospective reflection exercise "Energy 2010-2020", resulting in a remarkable and reference report on the energy issues that await us. This report shows that there are paths to balanced growth, ensuring compliance with our greenhouse gas stabilization commitments.
I will therefore simply emphasize a few points.
The national situation deserves a mixed judgment, even if it is generally favorable. France is undoubtedly today among the rare developed countries in a position to achieve its objective agreed in Kyoto.
Barely higher than their 1990 level, our current emissions nevertheless require a certain attention due to their very structure. The energy intensity of industry improved significantly after the first oil shock, but has since slowed down. The energy intensities of transport and the tertiary sector have deteriorated since the beginning of the 1980s.
The distribution of our emissions identifies the effort to be made to achieve the objective of stabilizing our emissions, contracted within the framework of the community commitment of an 8% reduction compared to 1990.
How to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions? We must act in all sectors which emit or whose current organization facilitates these emissions. The current debate on the measures to be adopted essentially focuses - I will come back to this - on certain market instruments deemed more "flexible".
Certainly, I understand that certain countries, having not yet shown a firm intention to evolve, wish to avoid the terms of their internal debate. The choice made by France, on the other hand, and beyond by all the countries of the Union, aims to largely favor internal effort, on a national or community scale. This is the only way to fairly distribute the effort, and ultimately achieve the global reduction objective.
This choice is reflected by the adoption of a national plan to combat the greenhouse effect, consolidated for the first time in November 1997. This summer I asked Michel Mousel to establish a progress report. This progress report encourages maintaining a strong focus on the objectives targeted by this plan. I have no doubt, as the Prime Minister reaffirmed on June 11, 1998 in the National Assembly, that the government will be keen to monitor its effective implementation and its evolution.
These measures must, of course, take each situation into account, but the priority is to relaunch an active energy management policy, also supported by private initiatives. In this regard, strengthening the role - and resources - of Ademe in energy management and the development of renewable energies constitutes one of the guarantees of the Government's commitment.
With regard to industry, first of all, I note that significant progress has been made to make processes more efficient: now representing a quarter of the primary energy consumed, the glass, steel and cement sectors , chemistry have already significantly reduced their specific emissions.
This result is also due to the structural evolution of some of these industrial branches. Indeed, the less profitable units that closed were also the least energy efficient. Since the beginning of the 1990s, these efforts have sometimes slackened and significant areas of savings remain in certain sectors. They must be exploited and their identification requires in particular the development of energy audits.
The field of transport certainly constitutes one of the priorities for action, which also puts into perspective the debate on remedies for the greenhouse effect, sometimes reduced solely to choices in terms of energy production and actions in the industrial sector. .
This sector requires long-term action, given the elasticity structure of its demand. It is not only a question of reducing unit emissions from vehicles - the community strategy has just found its first step with the voluntary commitment of European manufacturers - but also of rethinking the transport systems of people and goods.
Promoting collective transport, developing intermodality, are the main axes followed by the government, reflected in the Law on air and the rational use of energy of December 30, 1996 and, soon, in the Orientation Law for the planning and sustainable development of the territory. Beyond that, an overhaul of urban planning policies will be the key to a significant reduction in constrained mobility, which largely explains the explosion in the “transport” item.
The residential-tertiary sector also requires sustained attention. This involves improving energy efficiency in buildings, but also optimizing the use of electricity through an active policy of controlling its demand.
Correlatively, the information and communication technology sector undoubtedly appears to be one of the privileged areas of innovation, to improve the energy efficiency of products and processes, and to reduce travel needs.
I am struck by the precision of the documents written by several thousand American electronics, IT and telecommunications companies, bringing together in particular the 14 first American but also Japanese groups in the sector: new sensors, screens, broadband networks, electronics of power are all interesting technologies from the point of view of the greenhouse effect, justifying, according to these companies, that public interventions - including subsidies! - come to provide them with a national market and, beyond that, foreign markets.
Our options for energy production are unique. If the massive use of nuclear energy constituted, in the 1980s, an undeniable advantage in terms of CO2 emissions, notwithstanding its other impacts in terms of risks, pollution and waste, its predominance, including in terms of of resources devoted to technological development, constitutes a concern for the future.
This is why the government is resolutely committed to opening up energy choices, by relaunching an ambitious policy of energy management, development of renewable energies, particularly biomass, co-generation, substitution of most polluting fossil fuels, in particular by promoting the use of natural gas, or optimizing their consumption.
I would like to focus for a moment on the situation of coal, whose reserves are by far the most abundant among fossil fuels, and are vital, particularly for countries like China and India. It would be both unrealistic and hypocritical to claim that these countries should give up the use of their primary resource because of the increase in the greenhouse effect, largely due to the cumulative emissions of our developed countries.
An enormous effort must therefore be made to increase the efficiency of energy consumption in coal-mining countries, and it would undoubtedly be an industrial error not to continue the development in France of techniques such as circulating fluidized bed boilers, because they also represent an asset for French industry.
New industrial processes, less polluting or alternative fuels, development of less energy-consuming products, more efficient urban systems or modes of transport, but also more powerful communication tools and optimized logistics circuits are therefore implicit in the actions. concrete measures which must be undertaken without delay. In short, so many subjects which are at the heart of your competitive issues.
A balanced policy thus combines, in each relevant area of ​​use, regulatory and institutional, economic and technical instruments, but also strong incentives for the development of technologies, services, innovative products, and a market framework which facilitate their adoption. This is why the question of energy prices is central, in France as in other developed countries, first and foremost the United States. I have difficulty distinguishing how all economic actors will be able to preferentially choose more economical products or processes, if a "price signal" does not accompany this choice.
In the absence of massive subsidies or significant quantitative restrictions in the supply of energy, the consequences of which I cannot imagine for our economies or our businesses, it is in fact the "price" variable which seems to be able to to provide a long-term signal for many consumption areas, particularly transport.
The search for a stable and progressive price signal, also making it possible to relieve the tax pressure weighing on employment and investment, is one of the possible paths. This is why France has requested the acceleration of work relating to the draft European directive on the taxation of energy products, with the aim of tax harmonization, incentive for the least polluting uses, and energy management. .
If France particularly insisted on the increase in excise rates on fuels, compared to the Commission's initial project, it also underlined its attachment to a modulation of the tax rates of all final energies according to the more or less greenhouse gas emitter from the fuels used, as well as taking into account the specificities of industries that consume a lot of energy.
In my opinion, the examination of the consequences of this text cannot be carried out without studying the other aspect of this tax reform in equal detail, namely the reduction of tax levies weighing on employment and investment.
Furthermore, while numerous works - generally theoretical - have looked at the modalities of implementing tradable permits, I observe that few resources have been devoted to defining optimal bases for the French economy. Here too, I remain at your disposal to go beyond positions of principle.
I will also say a few words about the so-called “flexibility” tools, which I rephrase rather as “emission rights purchasing” mechanisms, because I do not have the feeling that these tools are necessarily more flexible. than other policies and measures. Several of them have given rise to a lot of theoretical work - you know that the very first winners of Kyoto are the economists - but very little to operational reflections.
I will return later to the interesting joint implementation and clean development mechanisms, which must correspond to concrete projects achieving real reductions, but whose implementation methods undoubtedly still require in-depth work.
Tradable permit mechanisms are widely promoted by the United States. They of course want to use them first to their advantage which is not necessarily yours.
Massively importing this type of credit would probably amount, for the United States, not only to establishing a massive financial transfer with issuing countries, with obvious geopolitical counterparts, but also to placing their companies as a priority among the ranks of investors. Such debt would also mean that this country is postponing the reduction in its own emissions, which would not be without consequences on several levels:
- small margins of maneuver would be left to other countries, and in particular to ours;
- the difficulties would be further increased for developing countries, which would find that the first emitter has itself evaded its commitments;
- the difficulty would be increasing - and probably insurmountable - in changing, during the next rounds of negotiations, an American situation made even more delicate by the divergence of its emissions.
I therefore do not think that the interest of France and its companies is to accept unbridled and unregulated development of these permits to pollute.
3°) The perspective of Buenos Aires
Finally, I will focus on the perspective of the upcoming negotiations and the working method that I plan to follow.
Buenos Aires will be another step in the implementation of the Rio Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. Schematically, three groups of actors will be present.
This morning, you undoubtedly had an overview of the situation in the United States and the countries sheltering behind it. On this side, it seems realistic not to expect major progress in Buenos Aires.
On the contrary, given a difficult domestic political context, their difficulty in leading developing countries like China or India into a policy of quantified and binding reduction objectives, we must expect that the United States is focused on calling into question its commitment, by all means.
Responsible for a quarter of global emissions, for 6% of the population, changing their consumption patterns constitutes a crucial issue, not only for respecting their commitments but also for our own situation.
At a time when the American administration announces that it would "achieve", arithmetically, 85% of the effort by borrowing from other countries, this perspective seems to me to carry threats that current economic studies have not apprehended. .
What would be the economic and competitive impact, for your companies, of a strong presence of an actor such as the United States on possible international permit markets, the functioning of which would have a strong chance of being largely influenced by the geopolitical context? What would be the context of the negotiation, at the beginning of the next century, if this country made so little domestic effort and in no way modified its modes of production or consumption?
In a context where the overall volume of permitted emissions is now finite and decreasing, the beginning of a decline in United States emissions requires an increase in energy prices in this country, as highlighted in a recent report. of the International Energy Agency. This measure would constitute the only guarantee of sustainability and compliance with the commitments made in Kyoto.
Then countries in transition or developing countries, an expression which covers multiple realities. I will not mention the specific situation of certain hydrocarbon producing countries, where the potential for reducing emissions is nevertheless considerable, for example by limiting gas flaring. This represents, on a global level, the equivalent of 4 times French natural gas consumption.
On the other hand, I will emphasize the situations of countries such as China or India, which legitimately claim equitable access to development, even though they have energy consumption per capita of the order of twenty times lower. to those of the United States. Nearly 80% of the world's population must make do with 40% of energy. As for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and those of the Commonwealth of Independent States, I find it difficult to believe that Europe will be satisfied in the long term with their very worrying economic situation, the only cause so far of the drastic reduction in their broadcasts.
In these countries, reintroducing a long-term objective of controlling their emissions per capita, depending on the economic level, also requires a massive transfer of technologies, and the export or licensed manufacturing of products that use energy efficiently. The virtuous development of their industry and their economy therefore opens up broad prospects, which other countries have already clearly identified.
I therefore wish to energize interministerial reflection and exchanges with businesses, on the themes of joint implementation and the clean development mechanism, which were presented to you this morning. A discussion is already ready to begin with a few engineering companies, but the circle can be widened depending on your proposals.
And Europe? Europe arrived united in Kyoto, and a similar unity is emerging in Buenos Aires. If active debates agitate administrations and experts, which is quite normal given the complexity of the subjects to be addressed, Europe's political unity is remarkable on this issue. It also constitutes the only possible springboard for the French position.
This political unity, symbolized by the joint and united commitment contracted within the "European bubble", reflects the necessary convergence of the objectives of the main countries involved. In addition to national policies, European legal, fiscal, industrial and energy construction justifies strong initiatives being taken quickly at the community level, in order to avoid any distortion of competition.
This project also requires in-depth discussions between us. I will therefore approach Buenos Aires with the primary concern of consolidating, and not emptying of its substance, the Kyoto Protocol, within the framework of European positions:
- reintroduce a notion of long-term objective, a mechanism for monitoring convergence towards this objective, and a sanctions mechanism, which conditions the effectiveness of the policy, in the manner of what we know in other areas of convergence;
- enable the establishment of rules for information, definition and implementation of policies and measures, including mechanisms for purchasing emission rights, in order to avoid possible distortions of competition;
- seek ways for developing countries to adhere to this long-term objective, defined equitably and allowing them access to balanced economic cooperation.
In conclusion, I will mainly focus on the working method that I intend to develop in the coming months.
We must continue an in-depth and objective exchange on all the relevant avenues that can allow us to confidently address these new challenges, and on the opportunities that they bring in their wake.
This day aims to contribute to this. I therefore look forward to your proposals and suggestions.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention."
"Mr. President,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr. Deputy,
Until a few years ago, this question of global warming was contested. I remember that at the time of the Rio Conference which marked the beginning of international awareness, there was still a lot of controversy, which today appears surreal in hindsight, between experts on this point. . Fortunately, awareness has progressed quite quickly and, today, this extremely worrying phenomenon is no longer contested, even if experts do not yet know how to say at what pace and with what practical consequences it will take hold. I would also like to remind you that when we talk about global warming, this is the subject of the Kyoto Conference and the Kyoto negotiations, we must not imagine a planet whose temperature would increase slowly, regularly and peacefully. . This is a change in climatic masses which would cause considerable disruption. In some cases it would be colder, in other cases it would be warmer and, in reality, we have to face the threat, even if it is with long-term average differences of 1 or 2 degrees, of global climatic destabilization, having tragic consequences, first on the agricultural level, then simply on the habitat, with even prospects of forced or spontaneous migrations.


This shows the considerable importance of this Kyoto Conference within which Ms. Voynet, who is the head of our delegation, is currently striving to find a favorable outcome. The favorable outcome, I repeat here for those who have forgotten, would be a significant and balanced commitment to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions on the part of industrialized countries, greenhouse gases being essentially the CO2. There is a very important point in this Conference, which is that Europe, despite its differences in situation and despite the difficulties it has, in other areas, in harmonizing its positions, has adopted on this particular point a completely homogeneous attitude, consisting of recommending for 2010 a 15% reduction in greenhouse gases and in particular CO2. The United States, which are the biggest polluters on the planet, taking into account their development, taking into account their industry, taking into account automobiles, taking into account their heating method, arrived at this Conference, through the person of Vice President Al Gore, with simply the proposal to stay at the same level, that is to say no change, no reduction.


Europe has arrived, in particular thanks to Franco-German cohesion, which on this point was complete and led to the position of the other members of the European Union, with this very ambitious proposal of minus 15%. I would also say in a moment to what extent France itself is exemplary in this regard. The United States did not succeed in imposing at the start of this Kyoto Conference - it is not over but, already, what I am describing to you took place in the preceding hours - their 0% line. They could not impose division in developing countries with the idea of ​​"license to pollute", which was invented to sow disruption among the members of the Conference, and they have just implemented before a new proposal for a reduction of 6 to 8%.


Therefore, France will have shown that it was capable of being forward in determining the European position, a position which became Franco-German, then the European Union. The United States was forced to back down. We still hope that we can arrive at an answer in Kyoto which would allow us to consider that the movement started in Rio has not been completely interrupted.


I would end by saying that France is exemplary in this respect since, due to its nuclear power fleet, due to its energy saving policy which has been carried out with great dynamism and technological ingenuity, it is the country which today, among all developed countries, contributes at least to this greenhouse effect. This gives even more merit to the position we have defended. The latest initiative being the plan adopted on November 26, which is the national plan for reducing the greenhouse effect and which, once again, puts France at the forefront in trying to ward off this threat for humanity."
